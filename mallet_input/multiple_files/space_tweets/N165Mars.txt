carrying some seriously cool gear lt shudder gt bit quiet here now gone but think it for the best look what happened to my buddy steve ouch used to think that just being rock on mars was exciting enough but then got laser attacked by nuclear powered alien robot car stay strong buddy and watch out for marauding space robots forget fridayfollow because can spare thought for my buddy beechey latest victim his new tattoo is pretty impressive though want regular mars weather reports generated with msl rems data check this site  follow of course what really need is good strong dust devil got caught in one couple centuries back it was awesome tried to hitch ride with the rover but couldn jump up onto it  been told should try this thoughts it looks like is going away to do science somewhere

you see me be waving if could good morning from bradbury landing text vid standtall don think directly in path anymore and the best part think might even be out of laser range the rover is now parked short distance away it looks like it backed up after turning didn see was busy cowering at the time two near misses and now much more familiar with wheels than ever wanted to be but okay woo hoo that was really close lt dust settles gt lt peeks gt is it over lt rumble gt lt crunch gt one of the wheels is coming right toward me feel so small and helpless the wheels are moving again it turning in place is it coming back oh the rover has stopped now it only gone few meters what going on phew the rover didn hit me gosh that was close haha maybe life will be peaceful again now lt crunch of gravel gt lt gentle breeze gt eep lt ducks gt it um it roving this way hey you  safe driver right did mention super pointy ack the wheels are really moving now um excuse me are you going somewhere keeps wiggling its wheels  flexing its massive robotic arm is it gearing up for something where that dust storm thanks for your support btw do you do size xxxxs interplanetary shipping thanks for sharing my shirt design those rocks were only airbourne they been blasted by rockets mars shot first sensor damaged this is amazing curiosity shot first not special after all appears fairly typical martian basalt watching wiggle its wheels back and forth now trying to look sharp and pointy another beautiful sol almost makes me forget massive arm towering above me haha lt wishes for dust storm gt if just after sunset you see bright dots in the sw by your moon  one looks bit red wave hello quiet night at gale crater the robot looks less fearsome in the dark and when it not shooting me with lasers wait the next thing you  sending over is giant robot with meter rock drill can someone come rescue me first don want to be rude but surely there much better science for to do elsewhere badrover stillwaitingformyapology eep is moving its arm now lt tries to blend in with landscape gt lt quakes slightly gt what difference sol makes feeling much better today and have over 4000 new long distance pen pals you guys rock couldntresist haha no none you have to worry you  too cute and little to drill but do you have any cousins there drill think just needs to be glad we didn drill it it just flesh wound it still wasn very nice though it been an eventful couple of sols somehow it helps knowing it was all for science but still think  stay away from from now on ouch have new name and now know what happened to me still kinda sore though you guys are so much nicer than when are you going to come visit aw thank you kids send hug and lots of kisses mt hugs lt you  helped science you  hero it been

making strange clicking noise now it kind of making me nervous maybe just self conscious because of my new robot friend it almost looks like it studying me must seem strange to an alien robot huh it seems to be getting warmer guess summer is coming early my new robot friend really does have quite steady intimidating stare guess it cultural thing people tried to make me think you attack me haha me just an ordinary little mars rock oh think the robot heard me it stopped moving and it looking at me again it does want to be my friend wait leave we could be friends now the wheels are moving is it going to go away did make it feel unwelcome my robot neighbor is making sound maybe it trying to communicate with me again hello helloooo my robot neighbor sure has an unsettling stare if looks could kill haha starting to think maybe my new robot neighbor doesn want to be my friend did say something wrong my giant robot neighbor is still just staring fixedly at me starting to get bit weird haha

it little shy lt putting best rock face forward gt wish could wave oh think  got the big metal creature attention now it looking right at me maybe it does want to be friends the big metal creature was scary at first with the rockets and noise but sure it just curious maybe should say hello so much going on around here lately the most excitement  had in millions of years but glad it back to normal now it beautiful sol here in gale crater
