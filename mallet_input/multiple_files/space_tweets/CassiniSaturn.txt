observations in couple hours iss cameras prime for this activity different temps for different instruments high gain antenna is 140 to 170c while uvis is kept at 10c and vims 216c not that cold my hardware is cozy 22 30c 71 86f inside my central body temps vary at each instrument component jpl top stories today feature two mars phoenix features plus my own team enceladus oct 31 flyby blogs cio ll miss too digs mars but everybody digs trajectory and mission desc for my oct 31 flyby of enceladus 2nd time this month to check those tiger stripes saturn cyclones are bizarre and beautiful and how big are they see the cyclones the answer in this vid checked with mission planning have have to be just above the cloud tops 62 200 km for sat to exert 1g of acceleration heat released from condensing water in saturnian storms down in the atmosphere may be the primary power source energizing the vortex saturn cyclones have no water at their bases yet the eye walls of saturn and earth storms look similar meanwhile there are giant cyclones at saturn poles downlink of enceladus flyby data images continues it 12 hour downlink team is thrilled with data so far enceladus flyby data downlink begins at 34am pdt friday at closest approach was zipping past at 17 km sec nearly 40 000 mph nearing closest approach to enceladus 30 pacific 20 30 utc read the mission plan timeline on page getting ready for that extra close enceladus flyby tomorrow 25 km wow the team is updating flyby blog here short engine burn today to stay on course on thursday fly mere 25 kilometers 15 miles above enceladus with swoop thru its geysers congratulations to marsphoenix for winning three twitties smartest most informative best use for news categories today charm telecon composite ir spectrometer instrument operations science the cassini quot scientist for day quot program is for kids in grades 12 look for overview flyer under resources have look at some amazing sept 17 2008 raw images of enceladus rec on earth sept 19 more on next page great day flew through the ring plane did distant flyby of moons mimas and calypso during solar conjunction which ends saturday my fields particles instruments are listening recording will play back to earth afterwards and methone were released today solar conjunction meanwhile some amazing images of partial rings orbiting with the small moon anthe the rest of solar conjunction will be quiet time can send telemetry to earth but won send sci data or receive new sequences cassini is in solar conjunction today unable to communicate with earth solar conjunction the sun is directly between earth and saturn we have pinpointed precisely where the icy jets erupt from enceladus read and see new pictures here new views of the alien world enceladus team members can hardly contain their excitement wow trip to enceladus was fabulous raw postcards arriving now thanks to deep space network at may need to refresh data being received now at the deep space network station in canberra australia blog with update vid clips at flyby data now streaming back to earth 900 million miles away billion km data downlink will continue all night so first downlink at 9pm pdt but the best images won return to earth until later tuesday keep watching for blog posts closest approach to enceladus is over some of the best pics are being taken during the look back data downlink tonight at 9pm pdt the water on mars is pretty cool too but this little moon has active geysers aka cold faithful video at monday flyby takes me through the water vapor geysers and should give me good look and pics of the area where they originate enceladus is tiny moon about diameter of our moon but it gushes water vapor geysers to distance three times its radius enceladus flyby blog is now up at for rss feed 080808 preparing for monday really close flyby of moon enceladus from just 30 miles 50km away that some pretty amazing navigation my next enceladus encounter is aug 11 the mission description news release are on my website pics on the web already look at my recent raw images radio science used the 16 hrs closest approach for gravity field observations my 45th titan flyby is complete  turned to earth and am transmitting right now mission description is here crusing past titan today at altitute of 1002 miles 1600 km this pass to study titan gravity field and love number mass distribution ftw first confirmed liquid lake on saturn moon titan but it not water it ethane you can read more here spent today eyeing saturn rings the intriguing moon rhea moon that may have its own rings close flyby of titan is next on 31 closest moon flyby to date was mere 50 kilometers 30 miles above the surface of enceladus on march 12 2008 will do it again aug 11 distant flybys of moons pallene daphnis pan and atlas today closest is atlas at distance of 18 000 miles or 28 000 km lots of flybys in my equinox mission next one aug 11 more in oct can wait but have to if you like science poetry in space look my latest data am collecting it you will be loving it my team has award win prods kids today will build next missions and tweet or whatever ask for grades love home movies my buddy epoxi took this movie from 50m km away of the moon transiting earth qs short as 27m descent with further 1h 10 on titan surface in 05 other jpl missions back answer one way light time delay huygens team often referred to surface that way good huygens landed on creme brulee like titan surface jan 05 movies and more esa yes the video of ring plane crossing at is my pov taken by my cameras 34 images over 12 hours lots of qs about other missions on twitter here some future lunar missions and also good unexpected finding of in saturn ring 2004 was later explained by the water vapor geysers from moon enceladus swooping through the ring plane of saturn today heading south to north here how it looked on previous trip in video was bombarded dust particles upon arrival at saturn in 2004 here what it sounded like when crossing the ring plane yup saturn is giant gas ball those altitudes for the flybys were my distance from the surface of the icy rocky moons also passed through saturn ring plane today from north to south and observed other moons enceladus janus and rhea busy day at saturn distant flybys of the moons daphnis altitude 43 000 km 26 000 mi and prometheus altitude 31 000 km 20 000 mi this week and next look up in the western sky to see both mars and saturn next to each other since 2004  studied the moons found few new ones too the planet and the awesome rings also carried huygens probe to moon titan launched in 1997 on billion mile journey to this jewel of the solar system arrived at saturn july 2004 now in 76th orbit of planet
