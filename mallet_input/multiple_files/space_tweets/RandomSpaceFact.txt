blog on the extraordinary comet ison the story and the unknowns from famous examples of back from the dead vampires zombies walkers bret favre and now comet ison thanks to all for amusing replies to my ison survived or didn or both tweet incl many refs to schr dinger comet it is now clear that comet ison either survived or did not survive or maybe both hope that clarifies things latest ison soho lasco c2 image seems to show more than dust smear comet bit back from dead our ison live blog updated soho video by showing break up  whatever made it thru comet ison seems to have been downgraded from comet to smear dust smear on images on google hangout and both cautiously think ison nucleus may be gone await more data from nasa hangout appear to not see nucleus head of comet in latest images may indicate ison has broken up challenger comet ison vs champion the sun one day only smackdown may not be looking good for the challenger comet ison or what is left is right now at perihelion closest point to the sun sizzling relative to sun comet ison is now moving about 360 km sec gt 10x the earth speed and gt speed of light relative to the sun in the time you take to read this comet ison just traveled 2000 kilometers 1200 mi comet ison updates animations and lots of links at our live blog with at comet ison fading as approaches sun could spell doom or but maybe not if comet ison survives its solar encounter it is outta here it will escape the solar system over time most sungrazing comets we knew about before ison were much smaller ison is first sungrazer over km nucleus 2km comet ison is brightening lot seen by spacecraft updated animations comet ison is the most observed comet ever from nasa spacecraft perspective comet ison rotates about once every 10 hours how close

orbiter was named for british ships of exploration primarily for one of captain cook ships nasa glory climate research satellite lost today rocket fairing cover around spacecraft failed to open condolences from alvin drew today became the 200th person to conduct spacewalk his 1st shuttle orbiter discovery launched its last when 1st launched ghostbuters was in theaters and reagan finishing 1st term space shuttle sts 133 mission launch at 50 pst will be discovery orbiter 39th flight the most for any spacecraft cool solar system family portrait taken from near mercury orbit looking out by

crescent moon scale solar system pt if the sun were at the top of your head and pluto at your feet then inner planets all in your head scale solar system if the sun were at the top of your head and pluto at your feet then uranus would be right where expected really most kepler discoveries so far have very short tens of days periods because kepler likes to see transits to confirm averaged over its surface saturn moon enceladus is the brightest large object in solar system new horizons launched years ago left earth at fastest speed of any spacecraft but still won reach pluto til 2015 largest
