night cometlanding my lifeonacomet has just begun  tell you more about my new home comet 67p soon zzzzz cometlanding you  done great job philae something no spacecraft has ever done before cometlanding loss of signal los no more comm with all science data from first science sequence successfully downloaded cometlanding now idling nothing happening on board power low loss of communication visibility expected at about 02 00 cet cometlanding lander now sending only housekeeping data at very low rate all instruments are off comm link alive cometlanding the lander has switched to stand by due to low power all instruments off comm link still active cometlanding link is intermittent cometlanding you  your team rock will use all my remaining energy to communicate between  myself with about right there are 45 mins left in this rosetta lander communication pass the flight director estimates cometlanding conce science data now coming down what super little machine on that comet cometlanding download link remains nominal despite low power waiting to receive conce data cometlanding gr8 just completed another rolis image that means that  imaged different spots on the comet cometlanding exploring until the end just completed measurement we just lost comm link for abt minute this is not unusual says flight director montagnon now it back cometlanding communication link with remains good teams working to download as much data as possible before battery depleted cometlanding final countdown battery voltage falling fast ulmec it won be long cometlanding running out of energy quite fast now look at the scientists watching how my energy is waning landing gear on lifted cm  main body rotation complete ptolemy carousel rotated housekeeping data are down cometlanding rather intense activities in esoc main control room tonight we  talking with comet cometlanding elevation is done and rotation is done so movement has completed battery is good not sure what that means lander now performing lift  turn of the main body on the landing gear will last about 10 mins telecomm link is good cometlanding mission team at esoc watching closely as science data flow from cometlanding science from an alien world cosac instrument data among info now flowing from cometlanding signal is back aos stable comms now reestablished telemetry  science data
