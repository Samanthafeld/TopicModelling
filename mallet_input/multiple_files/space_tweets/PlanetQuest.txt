screams of doomed planet being sucked into black hole scary if there is cooler profession than imagining life on other planets  yet to hear of it the planets orbiting kepler 11 can all fit between the orbit of mercury and venus one of our favorite confirmations using transit timing kepler 11 six planets orbiting in tight formation transit timing variation only works if with multiple planets in system each planet gravity slightly affect the length of others orbits another method to confirm planet candidates is transit timing variation this tells us if there are multiple planets the precise measurements rv can provide allow us to be sure that we are looking at planets and not something else radial velocity is watching star spectrum for the gravitational effects of an orbiting planet there are at least ways we confirm planet candidates but radial velocity is the gold standard speaking of congrats crew help remove candidate from planet status see our friends join their effort and watch of confirmed planets grow why so many candidates waiting to be confirmed we have to be 99 9999 sure before planet makes the cut let talk candidates 840 confirmed planets and 2781 official candidates with many more on the way planet highly eccentric orbit might pass in and out of the hab zone good time to be water bear creepy but fascinating water bears ability to survive extreme conditions may give us astrobiological clues with this impressive list of extremophiles on earth what possible when it comes to life on other planets the awesome habitable zone gallery lets you zone in on the zones of tons of stars with exoplanets the shape of planet orbit makes big difference for habitability highly elliptical would mean drastic temperature shifts think exoplanets are hard to find try looking for their moons this video shows you how it done http in san diego this weekend so are we come hang out with us and others from on sat at petco park age is big component for an earthlike planet too old and cool and the magnetic field is gone thus allowing solar wind to wreak havok reflecting today on the fact that we  creeping towards 1000 discovered exoplanets only few

around their stars almalive congrats to alma and today so much great science in store we  especially excited about imaging exoplanets almalive props to project1640 possibly the coolest named exoplanet instrument for spotting planet exo system remotely because planet forming disks around brown dwarfs are low in mass it is thought their planets are more likely to be terrestrial than gas not gas giant not star brown dwarfs are 13 80x mass of jupiter but too low in mass to fuse hydrogen as stars do closer stars may equal closer planets astronomers discover 3rd closest stars to the sun one of the coolest discoveries has been that smaller planets seem to be the most common good news for finding earth size exos kepler stares at 100 000 stars all day every day so far it found over 100 exoplanets and nearly 3k exoplanet candidates congratulations years of mind blowing exoplanet discoveries here to many more trapexoid this artist sees exoplanets in ordinary objects we  found planets orbiting dead stars before the first exoplanets ever discovered 1992 orbit dead pulsar star dying stars may be good place to look for transiting exoplanets with life smells like life could indirect detection

water beautiful valentine andromeda  perseus classic greek love story these two constellations have 22 stars planets do you have favorite constellation valentine day love or hate it greek constellations tell some tragic love stories did you know many of these stars have orbiting planets exomoons we  got an interview with the guy who looking for them maybe aliens visit us because our planet looks too hot lifeontheinneredgeofthehabitablezone good news folks earth is just barely inside the habitable zone we just live life on the edge is all nobigdeal habitability appears to be moving target bummer study suggests super earths aren super great places for life you think mini neptunes is going to catch on that cause red dwarf stars emit most of their energy as heat infrared light and black is the best color for absorbing it trippy thing about reddwarfearths is that plants might evolve to be colored black instead of green lolwut problem your exoplanet is just outside the habitable zone solution via big news about little stars dwarfs might be our best chance for finding nearby earth size exoplanet exoplanets were discovered at palomar observatory looks even the little guys are getting in on the planet hunt cool interview with geoff marcy exoplanet guru now up at planetquest is he eagerly hoping for an earthlike discovery not quite finally normal planet similar temp to jupiter or saturn in our own solar system got cool interview geoff marcy kepler coming up in couple days get ready to get even more stoked about the mission awesome pics of maybe an exoplanet orbiting sunlike star meet your newest avatar desktop and phone bkg image the kepler hardware has won some hardware of its own big props from popular science and popular mechanics for those of you anticipating kepler announcements looks like the first finds will be announced in january stay tuned is there life on planets around other stars read story in rhyme about girl on planet hunt 32 planets discovered the count is now above 400 and who knows what kepler first set of results might bring props to the harps team also wasp 18 which has the distinction of being the first dying planet found it got mil yrs before smack right into its star meanwhile corot has discovered the first confirmed terrestrial exoplanet it one of two super earth size planets that orbit the star ok back and the planet news has piled up for starters cross wasp off the exoplanet list looks like it actually binary star now we  got giant biggest yet planet that orbits the wrong way the universe is apparently full of bad drivers wild week for exoplanets first there was the planet train wreck discovered by spitzer in this case is roasting hot jupiter with day orbit and is portly 15xjupiter mass planet with super eccentric orbit hat 13 and have people pretty excited it the first time multi planet system with one transiting planet has been discovered another new one hd 110014b is little bit smaller 11 jup masses and has pretty eccentric egg shaped orbit around its star new planets hd 16760 is whopping 14 jupiter mass planet with year about 100 days longer than earth massive interviewed greg laughlin about planet that might serve as an extra gas tank that  reignite its star it the top story on planetquest anybody checked out greg laughlin blog at oklo org it dope well written cool photos and lots of stuff to ponder also had some folks announce that they observed the phases of an exoplanet as it orbited in front of and then behind its host star whoa planetquest isn dead we  had few new planet additions and some interesting finds like an exoplanet in andromeda maybe astrometry is technique where astronomers watch very closely the motions of star on the sky looking for the pull of an exoplanet it been quiet lately but here some big news astronomers find planets using astrometry for the first time way cool props to everyone who came to the jpl open house esp the robodome line survivors little video from inside the dome fun fact hat 12 transit was also detected by an amateur astronomer in portugal lots of people getting in on the planet hunt new planet hat 12 is sub saturn size planet orbiting in scorching day orbit if you  in socal this weekend come check out the free jpl open house see cool stuff talk to scientists visit the legendary robodome that not all hd 96167 is gas giant planet with an eccentric orbit that takes it as close as mercury to our sun and farther than mars reply the waterworld theory is based on its orbit and models that predict lots of ice water on its surface just guess for now so to sum up gliese 581 kamino maybe gliese 581 mustafar maybe confused handy reference the same team has also found that sister planet gliese 581 may actually be in its star habitable zone and could be an ocean planet this just in gliese 581 is just 9x the size of the earth and is the smallest exoplanet yet discovered it could possibly terrestrial kepler first light images are up woot check em out let hope plenty of earths are hiding in that starfield kepler will start collecting scientific data in few weeks so far so good the kepler dust cover was ejected successfully scientists now know what kind of background noise to subtract from the science data ok scratch that last post the dust cover will be ejected in about an hour at the earliest sorry for the confusion kepler dust cover is scheduled to be ejected in about an hour at the latest get stoked for 100 hours of astronomy some cool stuff like kepler and spitzer webcasts or the chance get to control remote telescope the other new planet is also in constellation draco hd 139357 is hefty 8x jupiter size gas giant with an 1125 day orbit well it been pretty quiet lately but finally we have some new planets 42 dra is gas giant orbiting sun size star at about au kepler has launched right on everything seems to be going well so far nearly 15 minutes into the flight this planet was teased out of previously existing radial velocity data for hd 11506 using bayesian analysis gas giant hd 11506 is little smaller than jupiter with pretty eccentric orbit that averages about 64 au from its host star planet alert not much info on corot exo yet but it appears to be hot jupiter type with very close day orbit around its star interestingly they have mean motion resonance meaning that over the same amount of time one planet makes orbits the other couple new planets announced today hd 45364 and are gas giants that orbit at about and au respectively eccentric orbits too despite what you may have read the new planet is not confirmed to be the smallest in mass discovered it about 11x times earth mass hot new planet corot exo is the first transiting super earth and maybe the first terrestrial planet found it about 2x earth size new super earth discovered hd 7924 is about 10x the size of earth but with tiny day orbit around its star bring the sunblock scientists using spitzer have just seen an exoplanet with wild orbit heat up over 1000 in just over six hours deets questions about exoplanets bring em on scientists estimate the size of moa 2007 blg 192lb to be about earth masses still pretty small but not quite as much as was reported heads up the earth size planet reported yesterday was false alarm some confusion between couple of reports kepler going to watch the sky for few years looking for transiting exoplanets and letting us know just how many earths might be nearby just 49 days until the launch of the kepler mission get excited we  got countdown and mission info at planetquest jpl nasa gov and the planet train keeps on rolling hd 173416 is about 7x jup size and has year almost as long as ours at 323 days first new planet of 2009 hat 11 is almost 10 jup size with toasty day orbit located in the cygnus constellation hd 181433 on the other hand is just over half jupiter mass and takes just about earth years to make its orbit we  up to 333 now new planets for the weekend hd 183263 is about jup mass and take about earth years to orbit its star ogle2 tr l9 is an even bigger closer roaster 5x jup size with an even tighter day orbit it no place to spend the holidays new planets hat is hot jupiter type planet that about 5x jup size and has quick day orbit time another roaster planet portraits keep rolling in french astronomers managed to snap pic of planet orbiting the bright star beta pic its sister planet hd 191760 is bit bigger 2x jup size and orbits farther away 42 au albeit with pretty eccentric orbit and the planet train doesn stop hd 191760 is about the size of jup and snuggles right up to its host star with an day orbit so we  up to 326 planets discovered but more importantly we finally have visible light images of exoplanets christmas comes early and finally hr 8799 orbits at 24 au and sits about 24 au from its star both hd 8799 and fomalhaut are visible from earth stars only hr 8799 is another big ol gas giant 10x jup size orbiting its star at distance of 38 au that makes for 69 000 day long year one of the trio of planets that was imaged hr 8799 is about 7x jupiter size and orbits hefty 68 au from its host also blue star one of the imaged planets fomalhaut is no bigger than 3x jupiter size it orbits about 115au from its host young blue star here another link with better picture of the three planets discovered from the ground and it doesn stop there scientists also managed to snap pics of more from the ground wow check it out hubble has snapped one of the first pictures of an exoplanet take look here big exoplanet news coming up later today stay tuned so now we  up to 322 planets these latest ones were all found in the southern hemisphere sky using the radial velocity method now this is big one hd 43848 is 25x jupiter size and has really odd eccentric orbit planet or brown dwarf it not clear yet hd 143361 is jupiter mass exoplanet that orbits twice as far from its sunlike star was earth orbits from our sun correction to the last post planet name is hd 48265 yet another poetic exoplanet moniker halloween planets hd 48265 is gas giant about the size of jupiter with an orbit about as far out from its star as mars is that makes new planets discovered and brings our planet count to 319 get the fine details on these cool new worlds at hd 20868 is gas giant with super eccentric orbit if it orbited our sun it would swing from closer than mercury to farther than mars hd 131664 is massive planet 18x the size of jupiter it has very eccentric orbit that takes it 1951 days to complete hd 73267 is 3x the size of jupiter with an orbit of 1260 days around star just hotter than our sun about 2x as long as mars year bd 17 63 is big ol 5x jupiter size planet with pretty eccentric 655 day orbit around its small star hd 153950 is also in the constellation scorpio is 73x the size of jupiter and is bit further from its star than earth is at 28au lots of new planets to announce hd 145377 is almost 6x the size of jupiter and orbits about half an au from sunlike star lupus tr is back on the list new evidence shows it planet this is jupiter size world that only 04 au from its star hot looks like lupus tr might actually be part of multiple star and not actually planet so we  dropping it from the count for now weird corot exo 3b is the size of jupiter but 20x its mass scientists aren yet sure just what it actually is link looks like the hat and wasp teams found the same planet at the same time so now it called hat 10 wasp 11 and the count is back to 313 this actually just refers to extrasolar planets not in our own solar system good question for those keeping score this brings us up to 313 planets discovered and 32 multi planet solar systems so far it busy neighborhood and hd 60532 is more than 2x the size of jupiter and orbits its star about as far away as mars is from our sun looks like today triple play for new planets hd 60532 is just about the size of jupiter and orbits at abou 759 au from its star new planet added today ct cha crams 17 jup masses into planet just times as big and orbiting 440 au possibly brown dwarf moa 2007 blg 400 was discovered using gravitational lensing an exotic way to hunt for planets using light bent by the gravity from stars new planet for talk like pirate day not much info yet about moa 2007 blg 400 it about the size of jupiter and 85 au from its star it been busy week for planet hunters new gas giants announced and one retracted for total count of 309 exoplanets discovered nasa has announced the carl sagan fellowships in exoplanet exploration the stipend will be 60 000 year to selected postdocs remember to see the stats for any of these planets just visit and type in the name of the planet tw hydrae has been dropped from the atlas due to findings that it might have been detection of stellar spots instead and one more hd 154672 which is about 5x the size of jupiter au from its star which is just about sun size big planet hd 205739 was also announced it 37 times the size of jupiter and orbits about au from its star which is 22x the size of the sun at long last we have some new planet updates gj 832 is about half the size of jupiter and orbits au from its tiny host star new story on planetquest jpl nasa gov backyard planet hunting amateur astronomers join the exoplanet race new big planet 14 and is 248 light years away times the mass of jupiter and has 186 day orbit see planetquest jpl nasa gov new planet 81 cet is 315 light years away times the mass of jupiter and has 953 day orbital period see planetquest jpl nasa gov new planet lyn is 185 light years away times the mass of jupiter and has 899 day orbital period see planetquest jpl nasa gov new exoplanet info released today hat it hot jupiter type planet with day orbit info at planetquest jpl nasa gov atlas the number of exoplanets discovered has passed the 300 mark with the latest announcements currently it at 303 just an fyi the planetquest site is planetquest jpl nasa gov new super earths discovered plus evidence that there are many more details on planetquest another new exoplanet around hd 102272 posted times jupiter mass 57 au from the star 520 day period new exoplanet posted today times the mass of jupiter with 128 day orbital period orbiting 62 au from the star hd 102272 new exoplanet posted today times the mass of jupiter with 128 day orbital period orbiting 62 au from the star hd 102272 june scientists have discovered the smallest planet yet it only about times the size of earth visit planetquest for details
