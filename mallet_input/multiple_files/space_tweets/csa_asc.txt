it the robotic handyman swapped out failed circuit breaker boxes on the iss mini here but mighty our flag on dextre on board the iss taken over canada driven by cdn flag50 dextre has finished inserting box into its new slot it been powered up and all is nominal engineer speak for good so why the swap one of the rpcms has lost partial functionality but can still be used if repositioned there are circuits inside each canadarm2 is now moving dextre over to slide box into the slot where box was then swap box into box slot switcheroo phew here peek at the room where canadarm2 and dextre

following live you  noticed that space robots move verrry slooowly for good reason too safety first always dextre was developed to reduce the need for astronauts to conduct spacewalks for routine maintenance on the iss exterior before dextre started replacing rpcms in 2010 exchanging the boxes was done by spacewalkers which always carries certain level of risk rpcms control the flow of electricity through the iss secondary power distribution system and tend to fail over time dextre is removing circuit breaker boxes aka by their technical name remote power control modules rpcms corrected link iss robotics are livestreamed here watch dextre work iss robotics are livestreamed here is driving dextre today from st hubert quebec with in houston recap so far dextre has extracted
