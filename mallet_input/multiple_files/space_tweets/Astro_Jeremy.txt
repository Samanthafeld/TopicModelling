beautiful detail but what we missing wonder what is happening around any of these stars proud of classmates  onboard iss fun working them  as capcom 2day photo of home taken july 2015 this perspective always causes me pause and ponder awesome to see  oleg launch safely to space next stop iss in approx hrs watching of course breaks out the cake right after and leave tunninik crater canada fortunate have centres of excellence like grateful team amazing opportunity leaving arctic today my experiences in tunnunik crater have left lasting impression of our beautiful diversity imagery like this helps identify locations within tunnunik crater for exploration made it out of tunnunik crater  arrived in cambridge bay aboard the trusty twin otter amazingly versatile twin otter doesn need runway to land or takeoff tunnunik crater beautiful morning here in tunnunik crater perfect visual leave this unique place with assuming airlift arrives evening planning meeting for ongoing tunnunik crater research supper time in tunnunik crater if weather is good tomorrow will be starting back to civilization bittersweet this patterned ground is formed by freeze thaw cycles in arctic interesting but horrible for driving on tunnunik every gyrfalcon nest we found had eggs or chicks this 1st nest was the best protected one  seen tunnunik came across peregrine falcon nests protected by parents but empty broken shells coincidence or population issue lunch time near tunninik crater rim for  livio great teachers of geology fm awesome day exploring tunnunik crater just got back camp  excited to see plutoflyby was successful snowy owls nest on same rock outcrops that interest research as we have found nests tunnunik crater same curiosity that excites me about plutoflyby drives me explore places like tunnunik crater bedtime tunninik crater also time to move my solar panel to north side of tent to collect midnight sun was surprised to see so many of these butterflies so far north adds even more beauty to the north tunnunik something different this morning when went river water realized hadn heard the sound before as from one end comes many new beginnings can you tell what came to rest here  brought nutrients for growth with the new crew came the rest of our food spaghetti with arctic made sauce on the menu tonight feel like million bucks after days in camp it warmed up enough to fathom bath in nearest river refreshing the rest of our crew arrives in tunnunik after days of weather delay now we have more help to unravel the and you were only few steps behind this man loves shatter cones so much he carried expensive lidar system across glacier cold river image th as barren as the canadian arctic might seem when you look closer there is surprising beauty here amazes me tunnunik kitchen just arrived tunnunik crater been waiting since wed but weather was bad our main food supply arrived too heavy lifting examines rock confirming it was dropped off by glaciers and not in original location anyone know significance of this dnd stake on victoria island had tri pod structure collapsed next it happened across snowy owl nest while exploring tunnunik crater took quick vid of chicks then left watc great day exploring canyon in tunninik crater rocks in background used lie flat prior chaos of impact tunninik crater has many examples of these beautiful shatter cones looks like wolf explored crater canyon as well hopefully we fare better than this muskox did tunnunik rained most of night in tunnunik crater but has stopped in time for today exploration of canyon we made it tunnunik crater camp is near canyon which will give insight into what lies beneath surface cool windy wet in ulukhaktok but weather good enough fly will be bumpy but hopefully next tweet fm tunninik crater too bad was hoping 2b sleeping in crater tonight instead of ulukhaktok although people here are very friendly boarding plane in edmonton next stop yellowknife on my way to tunninik crater on victoria island crater expedition details pic of small meteor fm iss larger formed 25km tunnunik crater excited 2b heading back to arctic on crater expedition tomorrow pristine beauty

one of our rover quite stuck today mud up to my knees teamwork got it out incredible weather today 10 deg  sunny spent day exploring cliffs of melt rock in the crater tranquil incredible weather today 10 deg  sunny spent day exploring cliffs of melt rock in the crater tranquil trying to solve gt 20million yr mystery takes detailed analysis measuring angles of shatter cones to solve the case the big guns jerome cores sample out of the rock to compare magnetic properties around the crater the big guns jerome cores sample out of the rock to compare magnetic properties around the crater the big guns jerome cores sample out of the rock to compare magnetic properties around the crater rare to do this in many places on earth amazing to drink this undervalued resource straight from mother nature these aren lunar rovers but they allow us to get to key places in this 23km diameter crater beautiful place crater geologist gold smile emerges on face when we find these shatter cones only find these two no space suits allowed wanted to explore outcrop at top of hill rock slides made it tricky here on earth topse turvy this ancient chunk of ocean floor was brought up from 1000m below the surface and turned on its side moving mountains look how meteor impact tilted different depths of rock layers in the rocks gives it away top like chocolate chunk cookie closer photo of rock melted by the meteor impact you can see chunks of rock from talk about an office with view my view during lunch another beautiful day exploring this crater cold in the standing on rock melted by meteor impact turns out grey hills are primarily melt rock with bits of the heated arctic love affair lonely rivers meet part ways then reunite on journey to the arctic ocean only these enormous selenite crystals were formed by water heated by meteor impact that dissolved gypsum  later amazed by nature beauty and resilience in this arctic desert this green oasis has been terra formed by lemmings  is their den providing the nutrients for plants to grow turns out this cave has hole in the roof fun place to play the rock climbing in used to be flat layered that not bear in the cave it me this cave was filled with melted rock that has eroded away leaving this map was produced by  displays rock types on surface of haughton crater from melted rock to rock at the top of the world gained some perspective on haughton crater today everything you see in this photo is this photo from twin otter on way into crater doesn exactly look like 23km meteor crater but doesn look theory is inside 39million year old meteor crater but like any detective must look at the evidence from this geology expedition allows me to simulate  landed on another planetary body  how would explore it perhaps these outcrops to south hold clues to what happened here during landing saw chaos amongst the typically solving mystery  landed in strange place flying in noticed this place has different colours then 09 30 my home in complete isolation next days discussed need for diligence as rescue not always possible at photo taken at midnight but looks like noon except sun is in the north instead of the south was strange to be took stroll on the arctic ocean tonight the ice is just starting to break up near resolute bay 21 10 all flts and 10 expedition members made it crater just like landing on another planet we 1st of twin otter flts carried oz alex scott  plus essential gear incase others didn make it 2day scott  enroute weather was good enough to get to crater 1st tweet fm island that shares name with my found this fossil on my walk in resolute anyone identify it for me weather not great but we loading up to try to get into the crater leaving resolute geology expedition begins weather permitting these twin otters will take us to haughton crater on devon island today took stroll on the arctic ocean tonight the ice is just starting to break up near resolute bay 00 walking to the arctic ocean came across this inukshuk arrived in resolute bay would love to see this magnificent animal from safe distance for both of us glad test worked still in ontario arctic tomorrow just caught my last glimpse of the stars next 12 days will be 24hrs of sunshine sending tweet from arctic may be more complicated than from iss this is test tweet via satellite terminal outside my hotel after canadian cottage vacation with family my acclimation is complete starting journey to devon island in the arctic lots to explore explanation why going to the high arctic to learn about geology with space rocks tues at 0810 edt chris  luca will depress the airlock and take stroll outside the space station now that is an adventure good luck iss great to see you in our nations capital today  thanks for sharing canadaday with us happy canada day fortunate to be celebrating canada day with family in canada canadaday cosmonauts on spacewalk outside iss right now preparing for new lab module to arrive later this year passez

take the runway it go time has2013 my best friend brent handy snowbird opposing solo lead will take me flying has2013 going in 1min walking out to snowbird jet passed another historic plane mosquito only one flying in the world will fly here snowbirds have offered to take me flying during practice show today amazing experience to fly with these professionals in briefing now flew sabre to hamilton has2013 lots of aviation history here like this iconic lancaster photo from 1st sabre flight had 3rd flt today fits like glove off to hamilton in the morning sabre tucked back in hanger after flt day me what an incredible privilege to fly piece of canadian history time to fire up the sabre for my first flight just finished memorizing emergency procedures for 86 these switch throws could save my life time well spent spending today getting to know this 86 sabre tomorrow will be my first flight very excited grateful for leadership and contribution to canada have feeling he will continue to do great things for us warm welcome for at this morning atv supply vehicle is about to blast off at 52edt cf 18 training involved air air refueling yesterday flying with 410 sqn in cold lake ab both challenging  rewarding more earthlings heading to iss tomorrow 28 may at 31pm edt have great flight ai te de parler avec dans 20 minutes spare space capsule this just showed up beside my parking lot at jsc must be test capsule from gemini days today mission control and iss crew worked practice emergency scenario to deal with internal ammonia gas leak prepares us for the worst hallway of photos in our office building welcomes expedition members kevin  back describes ldg saw grass thru window 1st time in 5mths when hatch opened smell of spring made them smile 2day hard at work adapting to gravity looks tougher than realized nice to see his wife helene helping at the gym too it tough adjusting to gravity update on condition by csa flight surgeon raffi kuyumjian more surreal than had imagined seeing walk down the plane steps after just seeing him in space yesterday made an impact we  got back at the johnson space center into lab rat mode now need to pull the medical science can you believe trip home is still going kazakhstan houston would have taken 45min yesterday today 24hrs many asked why they washed crews hands after soyuz egress looked like black residue from hatch produced by  entry plasma burning capsule completed phone interviews in england scotland hungary next one is in new zealand wow you really touched the world mixed emotions 2day relieved crew landed safe excited to see bit nostalgic about an exciting space mission tonight is medical checks for crew shower and then will be flown to houston by tues night journey continues congratulations canadian space agency your support for enabled an amazing mission just had chance to call family what an amazing feeling here an amazing thing just took place three humans just left orbit at 28000km and are now sitting safely on the planet awesome to see the entire crew out of the capsule now welcome back to earth you  done us proud roman looks great pulling others out now touchdown we are celebrating crew doesn know exactly when touchdown will occur must brace themselves early close their jaws and wait for the impact about min till touchdown don be fooled by the term soft landing thrusters they are basically explosives that fire at 1m to slow the soyuz roman is calling condition of spacecraft over radio mentioned the seats shock absorbers have extended ready to absorb extreme ldg shock this is the best part seeing good parachute and hearing the crew over the radio good chute ve heard flown astronauts describe the parachute opening sequence as there is no way this is nominal must be some ride parachute about to open then it really starts rock  roll soyuz has backup chute just in case deceleration will start slow but build to approx 4x force of gravity for nominal entry like people sitting on your chest tough to breath last landing was gentle one compared to what they are about to experience enjoy the ride we lose communication with the capsule during  entry this is normal capsule is about to interface with the atmosphere cue the fireworks soyuz capsule over africa now on final approach for kazakhstan crew busy now watching closely to make sure entry attitude is just right our view of landing where friends  family are gathered at mission control serious but confident excited atmosphere now soyuz splits in pieces middle part has our precious cargo other pieces burn up trash section  engine computer power section final backup mode is ballistic capsule rolls constantly capsule will land safe but way off tgt and over 9x force of gravity sporty the manual entry mode is hand flown by cmdr rolling the capsule left and right with offset centre of gravity can ctrl forces  accuracy accurate de orbit burn great news this de orbit burn slows the capsule by 450km after that the remaining 27500km is taken care of by atmospheric drag and the parachute soyuz de orbit burn is underway no turning back now they  coming back to earth now at least somewhere on the planet if soyuz automated entry system fails then it gets more interesting for crew crew will manually fly the capsule or enter in ballistic mode want to watch the landing live tune in here starting at 30pmedt will host big unknown in soyuz landing accuracy is not orbital mechanics it is the wind during the parachute ride 15min soyuz has excellent automated flt mode for precision landing within few km of target wonder what that will be like to sit in capsule waiting for final de orbit burn trust your ship  skills but some things out of ur control now crew waits for de orbit burn at 37pmet till then monitor systems ensure suits ready and strap in tight real tight watching soyuz departure crew is seeing view of their iss home as they depart roman comment unreal 15sec separation burn complete increases separation from iss soyuz 33s is on its way with soyuz hooks that have been holding it to iss are releasing now takes few minutes crew about to send commands to undock soyuz checklist after checklist  roman methodically preparing capsule for undock 08et crew in soyuz with the hatch closed next leak checks will ensure hatch is sealed taped ceremony shortly on soyuz capsule waited months as rescue ship if needed now it will bring crew fm 28000km hr to forces  fireworks has finished his work on iss  has started activating soyuz capsule for return with roman tonight 00 30ct  roman will have the ride of their lives soyuz  entry is violent jaw jarring but safe final day in space has number of tasks  crew are having lunch currently few more experiment medical tasks left look close noticed while working capcom is showing hockey team loyalty on his final day in space you can watch close hatch to their soyuz vehicle at starting 30pm edt watch at canadian space agency returns to

fun part of my day video of still shots from landing on mars wish been there to film it must have looked cool working capcom canadarm2  dextre armed robot worked together to stow newly arrived scan payload using ground control great work wow no small feat that landed successfully on mars last night canada alpha particle ray spectrometer can get to work now cool article on how canadians are getting involved in upcoming space mission all dressed up in the airlock but and have no spacewalk to go to awesome week in cold lake alberta cf 18 training missions and evenings spent with the cadets attending summer camp back in the cf 18 hornet again 2day completed annual instrument test great challenge  privilege royal canadian air force provides great weekend at yellowknife airshow with hawk one spoke with many young motivated canadians good luck to all of them congrats on successful soyuz launch and orbital insertion left cambridge bay in yellowknife now to support hawk one pursue your dreams campaign at the air show good weather 2day in cambridge bay now pic of our fav canyon from twin otter experience was privilege learned much we still know date of the meteorite impact but clearly much time has passed to beautifully tranform the landscape we  yet to see live muskox despite many signs including this fur scarf  enjoyed the frequent wildlife encounters our camp is located about 250m from an arctic fox den with kits got nice close photo of one of the adults uses this camera to image arctic clouds to test algorithm to detemine wind on mars using another beautiful stop for  while we checked orientation of rock layers in the se region of the crater mon poor weather here at the crater makes medical evacuation impossible for an indeterminate amount of time drives decision making socked in low cloud drizzle  fog accomplished geology goals we will be picked up whenever the weather lifts salma backpack measures magnetic anomolies in significant regions within the crater one way to see under the ground here is picture of our camp on victoria island we only have days left as we leave thurs will miss the arctic stumbled across snowy owl chicks while measuring rock outcrop adult stayed about 500m away took quick pic and left wind sand storm has descended upon us we have added extra lines to the tents to help get through all is well though bird of prey watching over us as we examine rock below it nest of birds of prey  have to look up at home evidence so far supports theory that the crater is 26km in diameter lots of ground to cover another interesting spot cass uses the xrf ray fluorescence spectrometer to measure the elemental composition of the rocks handy tool we spend most of our time examining rock outcrops but there is time to take in the beauty and wonder of the arctic we crossed this canyon river many times to examine rock outcrops some knee deep some swimming bit chilly but fun the scratches on this rock where made from retreating glaciers from the end of the last ice age we  seen more wildlife than expected here are tracks from fox wolf and goose all of which we have seen oz and find another beautiful canyon we found breccia created by the crater impact on victoria island canada we ran into the cariboo yesterday it was as curious about us as we were about it if you look carefully here around the pencil you can see the rock has been folded into hairpin by the crater impact when was the last time you were in place so pristine you could drink directly from the river you can in the arctic dr osinksi  venture out to crater rim expedition blog at expedition team lunch cass raymond salma annemarie oz  excellent team and will learn much from these geologists found our first shatter cone strong supporting evidence that we are in metorite impact crater some happy geologists mother nature excavated this beautiful canyon showing us the effects of the crater below the surface beautiful successful flight into the suspected crater the twin otter crew did great job getting us and our supplies in midnight on canada day in the crater on victoria island the sun is just going in circles land of the midnight sun happy canada day great to be in the true north on the occasion my napkin from breakfast commemorates inukshuk near cambridge bay from tonight hike head out tomorrow to investigate potential meteorite impact crater the north west passage is still frozen heading out to explore cambridge bay on foot now leaving edmonton for cambridge bay our geology expedition into the canadian arctic begins great day at alberta aviation museum with hawk one ready for pursue your dreams presentation at 7pm all are welcome at alberta aviation museum edmonton from  930pm 2day touring hawk one jet  speaking about canada future in space all are welcome found the russian space shuttle buran on river boat tour of moscow soyuz training in star city complete starting week of holidays in russia with my family rainy start but great fun final class in star city was russian language visited museum honoring yuri gagarin his highly decorated uniform interesting piece of history ejection seat russian space shuttle buran that flew once successfully but without crew some great questions today from the students at clara brenton public school in london ontario thanks enjoyed it when things go wrong learning options to eject capsule from rocket stack from launch to orbit can hit up to 20g ouch cool class today norishige  strapped into sim fully suited to practice life support operations great training just watched the space station crew open and enter the dragon capsule canadarm2 has grabbed the dragon capsule congratulations to the team norishige and are keeping tabs on spacex capture from our soyuz docking sim big day for spacex iss and canadarm as it will reach out and capture dragon capsule and berth it to station good news do fit in soyuz here the suit has been pressurized and is rock hard to simulate loss of pressure so they have russian sokol suit tall enough for me at but now the moment of truth do fit in the soyuz seat spent morning learning sokol launch entry suit your lifeline if soyuz suffers loss of pressure congrats to spacex dragon is in orbit will listen to the spacex launch from our classroom where we are learning soyuz life support systems good luck to the spacex team spacex had pad abort simple reality of such complex operations happy to see the rocket sitting safely on the pad following an abort optimistically watching spacex launch in 25min from star city at 55am est 1st commercial cargo to space station soyuz we cannot heat or  hydrate with warm water examples are tins of meat dried fruit bars bread cookies and juice setting up the dinner table in soyuz spacecraft if all goes as planned you will eat here for about days room with view the yuri gagarin training complex in star city as seen from my apartment here for weeks soyuz soyuz launch congrats to the crew and the team internet search nasa tv if you want to watch the soyuz rocket taking cosmonauts astronaut to the space station at 10 01 pm edt met with students from shaftesbury high check out video about cool balloon project future canadian greats great chance to speak to students at the manitoba museum in winnipeg today on my way to 176 air cadet sqn now walking on mars in this spacesuit at telus world of science great students there and at steele heights school 2day working with hawk one team this summer to inspire canada youth by demonstrating our proud aviation and space history canada first powered aircraft the silver dart at canada aviation space museum we  come long way in 103 years our 38 jet on the ramp in austin tx for quick gas and go on training mission today some great training last day of deepworker sub training view of cockpit control thrusters with feet hands free to control arm and write getting ready for deepworker dive today objective is using sonar to find underwater targets the red capped cylinder is the sonar murky first deepworker dive in vancouver dodged starfish and practiced emergency procedures more training tomorrow just been lowered into water for my first deepworker sub dive very cool started my nuytco deepworker submarine training today looking forward to taking it for flight tomorrow spent day at centre for planetary science and exploration at university of western ontario great geology training dr osinski alaura singleton examine samples fm meteorite impact crater in sk that we collected on expedition in july great 38 flight this morning super guppy parked on the ramp strange but cool airplane used to move large items flew the cf 18 hornet with the canadian forces last week had challenging week with training missions thanks 410 sqn the training space suit is on the stand ready for me to squeeze into tools for space walk training ready to go on my suit for day of eva training in the neutral buoyancy lab had spectacular view of our planet when arrived to work my capcom shift today beautiful video view from iss also enjoyed speaking to queen engineering students at cirque conference folks at the canada aviation and space museum fun day back at the royal military college of canada 2day to speak to some of the cadets enjoyed the visit final soyuz sim of this trip complete leaving russia for kingston ontario canada for few speaking engagements soyuz iss docking system class great mockup lets you see how the components work excellent redundancy designed in soyuz is temperature regulated with air conditioning cycle this pump 120 times every 4hrs to remove water from system goods news survived survival training not much room for survival gear in soyuz but what is there works starting survival exercise tomorrow training 48hr wait for rescue after offsite soyuz landing in winter forecast 20c could be worse russian segment iss mockup received new addition while was away docked progress supply vehicle right side happy to be back in star city russia learning about docking systems today docking hub of service module behind me chance to check out endeavour today at the cape what magnificent ship working capcom this iss panel returned from iss sits in mission control tribute to missions that built station had great month in star city russia training russia segment exams complete and now back to training in houston russian gas mask provides 20 140min of o2 depending how hard work for fighting fires and other air quality issues if see russian panel
