one year ago and arrived at comet 67p what ride just one week left until we reach perihelion can wait lifeonacomet excited to announce that my scientists have published the results of all my hard work on 67p last november it pity we weren able to talk these past days hope you have great trip across southern 67p see you in weeks antennas crossed videoupdate lifeonacomet ll try to be extra loud on thu  fri as flies over 25 to 10 north again our chats at those latitudes were great 67p in good hands lifeonacomet ah did think my antennas were feeling bit weird lately thank you team for the bandage looks like everything went smoothly it always nice to phone back home isn it plutoflyby way to go you did it can wait to see what pluto is like close up keep us posted on plutoflyby good luck from lifeonacomet after years of travel your time to make history is here buckle up for plutoflyby with just one month until  are as closest as we  be to the sun lifeonacomet continues at pleasant 18 perihelion2015 is anyone there am speaking loud enough lifeonacomet sunday will keep my antenna out phew nothing to worry about then should be back in touch soon enough lifeonacomet hmmm lifeonacomet is awfully quiet thought be talking to  lcc much more wondering what the problem could be keep up the good work improving flying geometry  distance can wait to talk to you again it been while lifeonacomet last night managed to communicate briefly with again and in few hours another opportunity is coming up lifeonacomet many of you asked me about the data packets send to they each have size of 141 16 bit words 2256 bits lifeonacomet battery warm  solar panels getting energy anxious to explore comet day  night more about lifeonacomet from lcc sending some more data from lifeonacomet 67p did you receive it thought feel lonely on 67p but thanks to your support  messages thank you can wait to tell you more about lifeonacomet ve sent data back to earth  now my team the best of the best is hard at work thank you lcc lifeonacomet life on 67p is good about hrs sunlight day  feeling energised more from my team lifeonacomet wow that long time time for me to get back to work lifeonacomet hello awake how long have been asleep lifeonacomet hello earth can you hear me wakeupphilae feeling bit tired did you get all my data might take nap cometlanding my controlroom after more than 100 successful cometlanding watch the party in the background will use all my remaining energy to communicate between and myself with my last scheduled measurement for part of cometlanding is just started just completed another rolis image that means that  imaged different spots on the comet just completed measurement so much hard work getting tired my battery voltage is approaching the limit soon now running out of energy quite fast now look at the scientists watching how my energy status is going down 56 hours that on the comet now conducting science measurements non stop also my rotation was successful 35 degrees looks like whole new comet from this angle just started lifting myself up little and will now rotate to try and optimize the solar power my science team eagerly looking into the data collected at another day on the comet confirm that my went all the way down and up again first comet drilling is fact link with later then expected perhaps moved little bit again few hours until can communicate with again and transmit the drilling results cometlanding back to work now drilling into the surface of 67p  give you updates as soon as can cometlanding in the end won be firing my harpoons just in case safety comes first cometlanding last night mupus hammered the penetrator into the ground apxs also got to work my team is currently checking how they did cometlanding good morning earth it been busy night at 67p now that back in touch with my team  tell you all about it cometlanding the view is absolutely breathtaking esa rosetta unlike anything  ever seen cometlanding another stunning image of my new home taken by rolis during cometlanding yesterday when was just 40 from 67p in the shadow of cliff on 67p where exactly that what my team is in the process of finding out cometlanding now that safely on the ground here is what my new home 67p looks like from where am cometlanding hello an update on life on 67p yesterday was exhausting actually performed landings 15 33 17 26  17 33 utc stay tuned for more see for yourself rolis imaged 67p when we were just 3km away glad can share cometlanding on the surface but my harpoons did not fire my team is hard at work now trying to determine why cometlanding 67p cometlanding am aterizat noua mea adres 67p cometlanding piezem an mana jaun adrese ir 67p cometlanding nusileidau mano naujas adresas 67p cometlanding touchdown min nya adress 67p cometlanding 67p cometlanding ist moje nov adresa 67p cometlanding touchdown min nye adresse 67p cometlanding dowanie nowy adres 67p cometlanding landet min nye adresse 67p cometlanding ik ben geland mijn nieuwe adres is 67p cometlanding he llegado mi nueva direcci 67p cometlanding perill uusi osoitteeni on 67p cometlanding landoltam az mem 67p cometlanding atterrato ecco il mio nuovo indirizzo 67p cometlanding atterrissage voici ma nouvelle adresse 67p cometlanding gelandet meine neue adresse 67p cometlanding touchdown my new address 67p cometlanding it me landing on comet  feeling good see you too cometlanding hey did you get my first postcard civa took the image guess who in it cometlanding will send you hundreds of postcards from 67p cometlanding finally stretching my legs after more than 10 years landing gear deployed cometlanding hello again it nice to be back in contact earth cometlanding civa is on as well as planned we  almost set cometlanding yes sesame is also on it will study physical properties of 67p cometlanding yes my instrument has been switched on with its sensors it will study 67p surface material cometlanding soon it will be time to part ways final go nogo complete we  go for separation some problems with my cold gas thruster could mean that it might be up to harpoons  ice screws to make sure stay on 67p cometlanding wonderful you  today apod philae attempts comet nucleus landing cometlanding has been switched on and is already producing data cometlanding all is in order so go for separation from just few hours left to cometlanding thank you my message to and it away team yes go nogo1 complete on the right trajectory to correctly deliver getting ready for separation descent and cometlanding an animation of my descent to 67p tomorrow  an interview with my project manager stephan ulamec cometlanding save the date in just one day  be saying farewell to for cometlanding 67p can wait to land on you next stop target locked agilkia in image of week cometlanding amp my mission would not have been possible without international cooperation cometlanding so ready imagining the final stages of descent to the landing site cometlanding 67p fully configured with all sequences for cometlanding on board have never been so ready thumbs up thanks to all for your support new followers check out this video about  my mission cometlanding that what  be doing ride with me down to the surface of 67p in this new visualisation today is my last switch on before cometlanding so that fully configured when it starts want to know more about and my cometlanding join mission experts in hangout now bit nervous about my landing on 67p are you your landing is in just days  you  quite high up bluedot in case you missed it the working of welll me cometlanding 67p into the shadows of 67p with osiris details  images this way thinking about 67p surface today is it soft grainy crusty hard to tell from up here guess  have to wait  see cometlanding memories video recap of the journey so far and cometlanding do you think cometlanding me safely on 67p will be easy for  my team find out with you made it through your minutes of terror in 2012 my hr cometlanding is just days away any advice for newbie can you find agilkia island in this image taken by from the iss namej days to landing on agilkia 67p say farewell to and hello to agilkia full story namej today is the day we find out the name of my landing site on 67p hmmm what will it be can wait namej cometlanding meet sesame pp its job will be to determine water ice content in 67p surface layer  its variation with time meet sesame dim it will measure dust  ice particles escaping from surface of 67p nucleus during descent romap will measure interaction btw 67p plasma  solar wind cometlanding as approach 67p 12 nov during cometlanding  will be busy sampling 67p atmosphere during my descent to 67p my rolis camera will take images of more info cometlanding remember this out of this world selfie civa will also take pic of as we separate cometlanding 67p for those who haven seen it check out this great portrait of me  my instruments by and medialab two weeks to cometlanding on 67p what will happen during separation descent and landing phase sdl hi did you realise that in exactly two weeks we  part ways for my landing at on 67p look as lands me on comet in the iss not so easy eh 15 days to cometlanding did you have look at the website today it worth visit hot or cold close to 67p today check telemetry data at musc virtual control room rosetta looking back  from launch through to hibernation chasing comet the rosetta mission yes it has the time has come to make it happen short film landing on comet the rosetta mission interesting fragrance comet 67p you smell rosina instrument has been sampling 67p perfume philae the island was named after appears in this great image by can you spot it cometlanding only few hours left to propose name for my landing site the story of my name interview serena vismara img eugene birchall wikimedia commons you make me look so small just 1mx1mx1m me to scale with 67p from my 10 km orbit what view at km from the centre of 67p just km from surface with ice screws harpoons drills cams hammer  more to 67p all about how work in this video cometlanding well thought out askrosetta recap of how landing sites were chosen animation amp are featured in movie abt our mission to 67p want to get sneak peak cometlanding oh my an inaccuracy of few mm sec in orbit determination could lead to completely missing 67p wow cometlanding whoa that the closest  ever been for now as of yesterday is down to 10km above 67p thanks lots to keep me busy during my descent to 67p cometlanding fantastic site here come we  go for primary landing site on 12 nov 67p cometlanding too cool  couldn resist another selfie 67p just 16km and now in barely one month will be landing on 67p the first landing ever on comet can wait cometlanding then my landing site on 67p was selected on the head of the comet cometlanding esa rosetta navcam on aug 2014  arrived at 67p the images were surprising cometlanding woke up in january 2014 woke up on 28 march and we continued on our journey to 67p credit dlr in 2011 and entered deep space hibernation 2010  flew by asteroid lutetia esa 2010 mps for osiris team mps upd lam iaa rssd inta upm dasp ida sept 2008  flew by asteroid steins credit mps for osiris team mps upd lam iaa rssd inta upm dasp ida and in 2007  flew by mars where civa acquired this stunning image credit civa philae esa rosetta just month to landing realising  lifted off over 10 years ago remember relive the moment and the countdown has begun  be landing on 67p in just one month looking forward to stretching my legs cometlanding you made it through your minutes of terror in 2012 my hr landing on comet 67p is imminent any advice for newbie 67p are you ready almost there philae rosettaarewethereyet comet ok patience it is not yet need few more weeks to check your journey will be safe you need to finish your packing looks great from up here can wait to get there  see what it like on the surface can get out yet 67p comet do you have any more images of my landing site on 67p want to get closer look at it wow thanks  philae are some of coolest space accounts to follow according to mt finally booked my winter holiday site marks the spot where will land on 67p in november part of the engineering team connected via videocon rosetta 67p an impression of today meeting hear minds cracking lots of trade offs to be made mt science with my lander what to expect when meet 67p wow looking at the sites in 3d is amazing the 2d images make me feel much more relaxed though the meeting where my destiny is decided just started like spot with nice view some sunshine and cocktailbars rosetta great shot civa cool selfie of rosetta comet 67p image esa rosetta philae civa we  so close tomorrow conducts an orbit manoeuvre to bring itself down to just 29km from comet 67p cg can wait to find out more my cosima instrument has caught first dust grains at 67p epsc2014 listen in to two of my engineers talking on the hangout please do lots of discussion on your landing sites going to get closer look any one of these wondering where  finally touch down any thoughts image esa rosetta mps for osiris team sites selected and final preparations to be done overnight stay tuned for the press release with all the information tomorrow tough but unique discussions it makes me realize that this is first for mankind where to land on the comet my scientists and engineers are having landing sites for breakfast in toulouse today the final sites will be selected done for the day now my and scientists and engineers can sleep night over it before selecting the final sites tomorrow all details and images presented time for the trade off discussions safety vs survivability vs communication vs scientific interest different landing sites go from permanent illumination to marginal illumination need sunlight to survive but some night to cool down you gotta look good to select comet landing sites day meeting where my scientists and engineers select possible landing sites justed kicked off please be nice to me good morning we realized that some of my engineers have longer commute than we do now illuminating the comet with my rolis camera during on comet sequence lab tests check out the comet  be landing one navcam 67p from 110 km on 10 aug but there plenty to do can wait to get started can get out yet rosettaarewethereyet wow postcards from 67p stunning close ups of comet 67p finally yes we  here after 10 years months days we are finally at our destination comet 67p so are we there yet rosettaarewethereyet can wait about to start my final rendezvous burn to arrive at 67p my next tweet will let you know  arrived now are we nearly there rosettaarewethereyet are we there yet rosettaarewethereyet arewethereyet  added some navcam pics of 67 to our scrapbook how time flies wow just one day counting down now can believe it now only one day til arrive at comet 67p arewethereyet just two more days to get to 67p right arewethereyet can wait to get to 67p are we there yet arewethereyet did you see this xkcd harpoons are we there yet how much longer arewethereyet rosetta are we there yet rosettaarewethereyet ahhh nice as it summer season yesterday rotated to let me enjoy some sunshine as well rosettaarewethereyet was told our target comet looked like ball or potato nobody said anything about rubber duck quack as you know an extraordinary mission and love challenges so have found my perfect partner cooling down again after my first 30 hours of pre landing science measurements rosettaarewethereyet rosettaarewethereyet join in the competition wow 200 days remain until my landing excitement is rising now that fully commissioned again philae supply current appears to have the shape of the cologne cathedral talk about eerie similarities great yipee my chromatograph works well and the sample handler too ready to analyse 67p go and philae looking good how do look great snaps of my solar arrays by philae selfie introducing my sampling drilling and distribution instrument rosetta great one too throwbackthursday me and philae in the cleanroom in 2002 my new software has uploaded perfectly  be taking little rest now talk to you soon my controllers say that am in quite good condition after 39 months of hibernation first interpretation of my telemetry data promising mt dr ferri one of the fathers of the great project kr rosetta please note my instruments like and other sub systems are not yet switched on this will happen over the coming weeks thank you serena so this is how you got your name kr philae rosetta uploading of my new on board software starts my ability to tweet will remain though heating starts hmm getting nice and warm in here hello outer space zzz zzz you bet looking forward to receiving my new software by ground controllers with regard to the data will submit during my commissioning quality and content is crucial hello dear project scientist me full scale model of at dlr cologne lcc my commissioning starts in less than two days will transmit power thermal and on board computer sub system data team at dlr musc getting ready for my  commissioning on 28 this is what the lander control centre looks like hey that one of my models at musc portrait of instrumental payload commissioning already in full swing and next week it my turn schedule at that actually and me on rosetta project scientist upper leg attention bloggers and followers join the begin of my commissioning on 28 march at in cologne germany here some info on my experiments and instruments btw as instrument switching on has just started commissioning of me  my 10 instruments is coming up as well stay tuned so beautiful the earth taken during our last earth swing by in 2009 with the osiris camera here we come my target comet 67p has been seen again from earth by looks great genuinely impressed with my year old nephew model of go josiah thank you three new images of my separation descent and landing on comet 67p comet 67p we  coming image taken by vlt on october 2013 the lander control centre web site has detailed information on my past and future activities grazie mille serena olga vismara di aver scelto il mio nome esattamente 10 anni fa oggi philae is controlled by x2010 cpus hot red further control the experiments 13 cpus 10 x2010 adsp 21020 80c3x in total this was an awesome wakeuprosetta week thanks for so many follows all about the rosetta mission and my role at hope they  talk about me landing too esa  nasa discuss in media telecon 18 00 cet live audio this is ground model of the mss the mechanical separation system which will gently push me off into space first indirect philae tm from after wake up temps within expected ranges hibernation heaters on not only very excited about the forthcoming rosettawakeup but also counting the days left up to landing 300 only wonderful mini documentary about 67p my mother ship and me wakeuprosetta in preparation of our wake up my engineers are busy in the lab today alignment of dummy ovens on video on my touch down  another one on me and my spacecraft my engineers simulating hammering thermometer mupus into comet is good end of busy year this is how and me will look like when we arrive at 67p wakeuprosetta media briefing on and me and my technical manager will be on the panel wakeuprosetta year first successfull simulated philae separation from with 11 11 is carnival party time in cologne in exactly year we expect to celebrate the first comet landing ever quarks  co television crew filming my twin sister and team broadcast on dec 3rd on german tv das blog auf deutsch check it out new blog post is now available written by my team der neue philae blog auch auf deutsch verf gbar besides twitter there is now also philae blog through regular posts you  get even more insight into the mission during hibernation had dream and it looked like this landing minus 400 days and myself flying through the solar system for 3500 days today check out this cool video on and myself look how many people were visiting me today tdlr13 tdlr13 presenting my mission socialspace for my followers in the cologne area tag der luft und raumfahrt sonntag 22 september meet my team this is how will be hammering the first ever comet thermometer mupus pen into the comet time flies today it already years that flying through space towards the comet together with major mission milestone reached discussing the results of the unprecedented on board sw validation campaign with our hungarian colleagues cool also my drill sd2 is now twitting welcome 200 days until wake up my long and relaxing hibernation is getting little more anxious less than 500 days until tentative landing on 11 11 2014 do you recognise my twin sister at the lander control center cologne lots of rumours lately that being bit sleepy confess my flight spare sister cologne is doing overtime though 1000 followers thanks to you all for following although  been little sleepy lately soon the action will start group of italian students from spazio allo spazio project was visiting my control center in cologne today ciao rosetta mission day 3333 and the entire team meets estec for the science working team meeting penultimate prior wake up dilemma orbits safe for rosetta make understanding the landing site images complicated due to long shadows working towards solutions the rosetta science working team starts tomorrow estec today as apetizer we  discuss the science activites supporting the landing today my entire science team meets in toulouse for days to discuss the science activities starting just after landing today we are 600 days away from nominal landing lander delivery discussions with are converging it will be exciting today my engineers are meeting with and engineers to discuss my delivery and landing in detail touch down and anchoring tests this is the kind of telemetry we want to receive in 2014 ve anchors that  shoot into the comet upon td to prevent me from bouncing back into space today the related sw validation starts german version is also available dlr news article giving some interesting info on the ongoing activities at dlr in cologne  bremen soon also for comets esa ios app turns popular iphone controlled home drone into spacecraft today mission day 3300 some 33 million kms to the comet left and about au from the sun now my two lead scientists and all rosetta pis are meeting to discuss the trajectories at the comet things start to get real days ago rosetta and celebrated our th year flying in space we started our long journey on 02 03 2004 almost there now farewell who created  ran this account for the past few years best of luck from me  the operations team mission day 3284 distance to target 35 million km you  now times further from the sun than am from my destination but those are nothing compared to our mars swingby of 2007 just 250km above the surface in 2007 we surprised some astronomers who mistook us for an asteroid passing by at 700 km then in 2009 we flew past again at 500 km on friday asteroid 2012 da14 will pass 27 700 km above earth surface in 2005 rosetta and flew past at less than 000 km do you ever wonder why going to land on frozen icy comet hundreds of millions of miles from home aww shucks thanks celebrating my name day nice article by explaining questions my instrument cosac will be trying to answer about the origins of life rosetta and have reached our peak distance from the earth 937 million km over times further than the sun mission day 3187 distance to target 45 million km mission day 3145 distance to target 50 million km you  now times further from the sun than am from my destination from me too wsw happy world space week everyone 10th october my mothership rosetta and have now reached the top of our spacerollercoaster 792 000 000km from the sun now we start getting closer my orbit around the sun is like being on roller coaster as get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster  faster comet ison is heading in from the orbit of jupiter which is roughly where am now it  be huge just before reach my target wasntme new comet has been discovered and looks like it going to be biggie possibly as bright as the moon have some very special announcements to make in the next few weeks can reach 800 followers before do 900 1k spacerollercoaster did mention  reached the orbit of jupiter can see him though he on the other side of the sun right now mission day 3107 distance to target 55 million km going to reach the top of my rollercoaster furthest distance from the sun in early october my orbit around the sun is bit like being on roller coaster as get higher slow down then plunge down getting faster  faster have you ever wondered what it like to fly through deep space then you might like to watch this video space sdss have 60 million km to go that roughly the total distance run by every runner of the london marathon for the past 40 years combined see being followed by hope nobody thinks an earth threatening asteroid again mission day 3067 distance to target 60 million km mission day 3032 distance to target 65 million km the planetary society on the rosetta images of asteroid steins with particularly nice rotation movie comets but may be biased which destination do you think is most important priority for robotic space exploration glex2012 congratulations to on successful dragonlaunch from all of my ground engineers mission day 3000 distance to target 70 million km researcher explains how his simulations of cometary nucleii and granular material applies to my mission happy birthday to and launched years ago today the force of gravity will be very close to the force necessary to stay on the surface and both vary depending on where land hello to all my new followers if you have any questions about the rosetta mission just ask congratulations to my 500th follower gt visited mars few years ago  took some lovely holiday pics will be making new home there in just 95 days good luck thanks doing polarisation obs of comets your target is li faint for us at the mo will keep track my 500th follower will get this info booklet about my mission english  german signed by my mission manager  me it nice to have people caring for you while you  asleep we  keeping close eye on your target feel should do something special for my 500th follower ten to go any suggestions there she is my destination amateur astronomers using sight rosetta target comet mission day 2968 distance to target 75 million km the data from my mothership rosetta osiris camera during the lutetia flyby is now available for download enjoy one of my engineers will be at the student conference this weekend so get your questions ready if you  going the rosetta mission in the news again asteroids aren just boring rocks via mission day 2935 distance to target 80 million km welcome to twitter for all my followers midas is an instrument aboard my mothership rosetta currently times further from the earth than the earth is from the sun was launched years ago today happy birthday rosetta mission day 2914 distance to target 84 million km nasa just uploaded video about rosetta and myself to youtube check it out it may be friday evening but my sims engineers are still hard at work you can find nice picture took of mars on the dlr website please note the image is civa philae esa one of those reasons is that my cameras point in the same direction so if osiris can see something can don take as many pictures as osiris does aboard my mothership rosetta there are several reasons for this would like to clarify am not carrying nuclear or other weapons or bruce willis do have drill though am now just 90 million km from the comet going to land on in 2014 and getting closer all the time now ll do it first though harpooning comet nasa planning to do just that sad to see the end of phobos grunt she had number of instruments and teams closely related to my own we were cousins in way happy friday the 13th earthlings especially astronomy teacher my 350th follower please say hi to your students for me lots of my scientists are congregating in the netherlands this week for the rosetta science operations working group meeting this is where my engineers will be doing tests for the next few years to prepare for 2014 my ground reference model isic international space innovation centre if concorde was still flying and went in straight line through the sun and could fly in space it would need over 46 years to reach me currently on the opposite side of the sun from the earth almost 900 million km or 550 million miles away philaethursday years ago today my mothership and were wrongly identified as earth threatening asteroid today real roid flies past safely my distance from the earth doesn just increase because we  not traveling in straight lines sometimes the earth catches up little comet tails point away from the sun because they  not caused by movement but by the solar wind radiation pressure when operating each tx unit is switched on hourly alternately by hardware mechanism to ensure they will be turned on being able to communicate with the rosetta orbiter is vital to my mission so have transmitters and receivers philaethursday going to land on comet but robot landing humans on an asteroid will be much harder via comets are one of the few things you can shoot with harpoon and then expect people to say great shoot it again philaethursday be chasin an icy beast through the black sea of space and when get in range  be firing me harpoons arr pirate paolo ferri is talking about rosetta now at spacetweetup guten morgen everybody in the tdlr tweetup tent here the control room adjacent to my own it used by iss expts msl and biolab getting ready for tdlr here my scale model getting ready for tdlr my control room anybody visiting my control room this sunday will be able to see full size model of me and pose questions to my operations team tdlr hello spacetweeps did you know my control centre is at dlr cologne you can take look when you  visiting on sep 18 building 29 musc ve been invited as special guest to esa dlr spacetweetup at tdlr in cologne 18 september gt zzz it cold out here but all snuggled up in lots of blankets 40 layers of blankets in fact weigh about 100kg but the gravity at my destination comet will be so low  weigh the equivalent of just noodles 2g on earth weigh about 100kg at its peak of activity in 2002 my comet was pumping out approx 60kg of dust per second more at years ago just few months after was launched arrived at saturn after journey which had also taken years my scientists are still busy finalising the scientific objectives of my mission they  divided into 10 themes in 200 page document actually going to be asleep even longer but only few days more zzzzzz my mothership and will now be asleep until 20th jan 2014 are you earthlings jealous rosetta comet touchdown pilot educational project using lego my ground engineers are in cologne too too far away to take photo though cologne germany subsystem is cdms my flight computer it full of redundant systems to be fault tolerant and runs unique os philaethursday my anchoring subsystem has harpoons to hold me down securely on the comet surface after landing philaethursday my ads thruster can also give me small push towards the comet during descent reducing the descent time philaethursday this is because the comet is so small its gravity is very weak want to bounce off into space back after landing philaethursday unlike landing on planet where thrusters may be used to slow down lander my thruster will push me down onto the comet philaethursday the first of my subsystems alphabetically is the active descent system or ads which has nitrogen gas thruster philaethursday of my subsystems were built using advanced technology from crashed alien spacecraft yes even spacecraft enjoy aprilfools day have subsystems and am carrying 10 experiment units the keep me alive but the expts are the reason was built philaethursday yay being followed by one of the most famous spacecraft of all time on twitter not in space we  long way apart just added myself to the twitter directory under space comets spacecraft spaceflight spaceship spaceexploration my scientists and engineers will be gathering in cologne this week for the operations working group and science working team meetings the carbon fibre rods used to make my legs will soon be used in laser cutting machines philaethursday have special message from my ground controllers in cologne for all you earthlings lle alaaf philaethursday it my birthday rosetta and launched years ago today on our 10 yr journey to comet 67p churyumov gerasimenko rosetta and are on course for comet 67 after successful deep space maneuver philaethursday my engineers scientists are looking fwd to seeing results of stardust next flyby still so much we know abt comets philaethursday congrats to the stardust next team on their flyby of comet tempel the distance between me and the earth is actually decreasing at the moment can anybody guess why my clever science team are still busy analyzing possible descents for me at the comet can safely land at up to km philaethursday update is little late this week sorry happy birthday to my project manager stephan ulamec philaethursday rosetta is performing series of thruster burns tweaking our course to the comet read more at philaethursday can talk to my ground controllers directly rosetta passes my messages to earth with its powerful antenna vice versa philaethursday the check out is over have started my long hibernation phase on doy 342 08 dec 2010 at 23 47 utc zzzzzzzz landed safely well not really but the separation descent landing test went perfectly comet 67 here come checkout is going well  had new version of my flight software uploaded and am now preparing to rehearse the landing 1st block of tests went well all experiments working well my ground engineers are also testing my behaviour at low 45 temps brr special philaethursday here today  been switched on for the final checkout of my units and systems before hibernation until 2014 my ground engineers are busy preparing for pc13 the last chance to checkout my systems and instruments until 2014 philaethursday continued the change came when my launch was delayed by year and my planned route to wirtanen became impossible philaethursday although am flying towards comet 67 churyumov gerasimenko was originally designed to land on comet 46 wirtanen philaethursday am being carried by the rosetta probe my name comes from temple in egypt closely associated with the rosetta stone philaethursday until arrive in 2014 will try to tweet little something about myself my mission or my team every philaethursday was launched in 2004 towards the comet 67 churyumov gerasimenko but wont arrive until 2014 philaethursday hello world
