liters of saliva onto field hand stitched balls rubbing mud leather mitts wooden bats pine tar baseball game untouched by modern materials fyi laws of physics show that it takes twice as much energy to throw baseball 100 mph than it does to throw one at 70 mph about that slow pitch bugsbunny can throw slower one he subject instead to cartoon laws of physics slowest pitch in baseball to reach catcher 30 mph thrown at 45 deg angle any slower and at any other angle hits the ground does it disturb anyone else that the los angeles angels baseball team translates directly to the the angels angels curious that intent is assigned by announcers when batter gets hit yet 70 of the time the player can get hit at all baseball is ideal for talking  tweeting  tracking stats only 30 min of actual playing time in hr game never figured why the foul pole is called the foul pole when it entirely in fair territory should be called the fair pole baseball should track extraordinary plays that fielders can bank and then credit against errors they might later commit in baseball if pitch hits you on ball four you should get to advance to second base you can play baseball on the airless moon but only if you find way not to suffocate  if you care about curve balls if baseball reported averages to decimal places instead of then three hundred hitter would be batting three thousand in the

anything session completing trilogy later in february will tweet notice of it loss of science literacy not long ago those who agreed were on the same wavelength but today they  on the same page whenever the twitterverse calls and the spirit of science moves me feel compelled to textify gop tends to be better for nasa so do you favor them over obama you ask  never been one issue voter never

most important area of science today all of them and it their cross pollination that breeds innovation concerned about scientifically illiterate elected officials not their fault blame who voted for them why leap seconds fun to add but of no consequence to daily life happy to wait til they sum to an hour why increase funding for space exploration you ask there is no greater force on ambition than nasa vision what effect will nasa future have on science education everything more people need to be convinced of that fact why are adults more superstitious than children you ask they need something
