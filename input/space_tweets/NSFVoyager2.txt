6km conclusion not big difference so that leaves us me 792kg of which 105kg was hydrazine fuel comparison say burned it all 1ce would gain 3km if we had ion engines we would still have to pay that initial price  the only way we know how is with chemical propellants we had arrive jupiter having paid 17 km propellants achieve this most of that was spent in the first 1000sec of ignition used jupiter to gain 10 km of that cost  saturn gave me another km uranus gave km but gave them back to neptune we voyagers only about 38 km of the way there  would never have made it the help of planetary slingshots ion engines or not gravity well we  dealing with is sol  it huge one in terms the energy cost of climbing out is 42 km  we  always hve deal the tyranny of the rocket equation see nice piece by the gravity lately  received lot of qs about how my trip would have been different with newer propulsion system like an ion engine however
