russian food  toilet for at least day houston making safe plan lost count of the number of times that we practiced this exact procedure in the simulators in houston serious risk requires serious prep the crew has several ammonia sensors onboard they used them in the russian section while wearing masks no ammonia seen took masks off would also then need to fix any leak and ship up new ammonia supply hopefully none of that will be needed here quick solution is to vent the external ammonia out into space there are systems so that would lose half cooling big effect inside will know soon if it real leak or sensor malfunction everyone treating it seriously doing it right by the book ammonia is an excellent coolant but is poisonous to breathe 1st indication of leak through is internal pressure rise nasa checking we train for it  the crew and mcc have responded well crew is safe looking closely now to be sure what happened  thus what to do next ammonia is used for cooling through pipes  heat exchangers on the outside of station if it breaks through inside it is of the big emergency on the space station high pressure ammonia may be leaking inside crew closed hatches safe for now in russian segment analyzing can even name some of these instruments in studio today with beagle fans rejoice probably several more launches coming up chance to perfect the new technology  thus
