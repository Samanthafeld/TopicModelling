cassini is now at apoapsis most distant point from saturn on its orbit beginning rev 220 21 day orbit with an inclination of today cassini is performing distant observations of saturn moon hyrokkin to study its pole direction and shape today cassini will spend 17 hours observing saturn and rings just checking in from vacation to mention that my year old  are both loving the wings of fire fantasy book series by tui sutherland cassini is now observing faint crescent enceladus to monitor its plumes today cassini is observing the edge of saturn shadow as it falls on the planet distant phoebe ring ok folks going on vacation through aug keep those spacecraft humming while gone pre scheduled cassini tweets will continue there sad cartoon in here somehwere cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from north to south at position just outside rhea orbit cool raw image from cassini this morning targeted at pandora lot of stuff going on in this picture never get called to be on the good shows  only been called for pseudoscience stuff if you haven been taking notes that good resolution rhea dione and enceladus observations by all in the last 24 hours cassini is now photographing enceladus trailing hemisphere from distance of 111 420 km cassini is now at the periapsis closest approach to saturn of rev 219 between the orbits of enceladus and tethys whole family has been watching specialolympicsworldgames on and it been uplifting inspiring and making us smile all day cassini is now pointed at dione acquiring mosaic it  get crescent view slightly later cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from south to north at position little bit inside rhea orbit cassini optical remote sensing instruments are now pointed at rhea leading hemisphere taking photos and spectra today cassini is taking snapshots of saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits ok folks this impromptu and has been fun but it bedtime ttfn don have any idea and the pictures are pretty bad let go back to neptune to answer this question when was in grad school tried to be theorist felt like was making everything up like data enjoy mysteries that drive theorists crazy the search for new horizons targets after pluto revealed the kuiper belt to be deficient in small objects it is not but we rarely know which simplified set of physical rules to apply planets are easier than people there nothing planned but there is discovery mission proposal called io volcano observer it physics an all ice world larger than 500km will have gravity enough to overcome ice strength become round yeah but the more they  paid the more they seem to think they have all the answers and they  wrong something something nice model remember help huh so they are not actually on the books to head to phobos just proposal for now can make the kessel run in less than that pretty much if an atmosphere is collisional if you can knock one atmos molecule into another you  got wind kuiper belt ends at 47 au only two known worlds stay entirely outside it sedna  2012 vp113 not at the moment but phobos is popular target and  bet we  see missions planned in the future scientists have perfect job security every answer generates more questions true story clarke called into europa mtg at jpl to say landing on europa was ok nobody seems to have recorded it there huge difference between trolling and not yet informed curiosity curiosity is good no they  either captured or are impact ejecta or something one recent paper no they formed in place in nebula centered on jupiter read robin canup pluto is weird but not this weird it is an ice rock world big enough to generate its own geology and weather we know what made pluto mountains yet that will be very fun puzzle for geologists to solve there isn much yet but there will be soon from new horizons for topo need overlapping photos or limb views temperature too hot in early inner solar system for volatiles to condense terrestrial planets are volatile poor depends on density which is widely variable among kbos all are thought to be mix of mostly ice and rock the new horizons team solicited name suggestions from the public and is working with the iau probably pluto is probably mostly made of water ice water ice is stiff enough at pluto temp to support mountains cassini is now at its closest approach to titan of rev 219 but titan is far away 730 000 km cassini will take photos to look for clouds this graphic by shows how much of pluto was actually covered at this resolution more good frames here my version of the sputnik planum mosaic sorry had to delete the mosaic tweet because of bonehead mistake in the credits will reissue it shortly updated my pluto data index page this will be last update til after my vacation aug 10 today sent email to several scientists with subject line omg haze and it seemed right in the moment but now it seems little silly blog entry looking back at pluto at last  finished filling out the chart the new horizons pluto flyby data set aha the last two missing frames have appeared made the pluto haze diagram metric ftfy all their sunrises and sunsets titan from cassini and pluto from new horizons to scale one more raw frame has shown up from hi res charon mosaic but it contains nothing prolly pointed at space mvic images do not get raw release treatment they haven downlinked many anyway have pr released what they have yes indeed it is go here aha these slides are much better thanks the raws being posted are auto contrast enhanced and lossy jpeg compressed not full fidelity data still not seeing the frame mosaic on nasa website same fate as the mosaic from last friday lol at least nasa consistent the new charon frame in context courtesy of gordan ugarkovic looks like three of the high res frames pluto charon got lost in the pipeline somewhere working here are the last images needed to make that mosaic  been hassling people about all week are we seeing topography on edge of pluto disk here the raws for the 2x2 mosaic of pluto omg they took 2x2 of hydra to make sure they didn miss it and got it in all rawwwwww imageeesssssss briefing over going to start working little but am waiting for raw image release to really get to work on my post means as you go deeper in pluto temp gets warmer pressure gets higher they offset almost exactly n2 no likelier to melt at depth woohoo cold space ice rheology thanks mckinnon lower density of pluto increases thickness of icy mantle increases geophysical likelihood there is still an internal ocean pluto spins slowly so you wouldn expect it to be oblate unless it had frozen in shape from earlier faster spin like iapetus yes very good anybody know where can read about phsyical properties of nitrogen ice with what about co or ch4 ice mckinnon even at 38 kelvins solid nitrogen can creep at depth it will be warmer it very sensitive to temperature mckinnon just you wait until the rest of these images come because know there going to be great stuff there stern we  reacting to these images in almost real time we  learning there is intricate interaction between geology  climate this my friends is why we explore and also why planetary exploration is awesome fundplanetary have lot of questions but think anybody can actually answer them yet mckinnon sputnik planum ices seem to have moved and surrounded and embayed hillary montes just feather out onto edge of cthulhu regio where is that mosaic want that mosaic olkin tombaugh regio has methane nitrogen and carbon monoxide ices this is telling us something we need to understand olkin pluto north pole is tilted about 120 degreees that means pluto north pole points south of ecliptic summers there is an argument going on in the team about whether this is dynamics or chemistry but this is our first peek at weather summers this is the image that almost brought us to tears lol almost stern you see above the dark disk of pluto band of light that tells you that pluto has haze in its atmosphere stern charon occultation is basically square wave showing it has much less atmosphere than pluto if any stern in looking more carefully at tombaugh regio right lobe looks like much thinner deposit we believe source to be western lobe stern for next couple of months until mid september it will only be occasionally that we  have new images to release how the sun makes tholin at pluto cc haze layers guys haze layers have not called in to ask question find it awkward to listen to phone audio watch nasa tv simultaneously plutoplutopluto wait you  flown to the wrong planet that not pluto that titan want to know how cratered we expect pluto to appear here the reference reasons for image comm delay are complicated background here and here because mission shares raw data you can see pics as they come from camera more coming today you  looking at north pole in these images reddish area at top south pole is out of view in winter darkness the more pixels we get on pluto the more craters see jupiter changing face 2009 2015 photos by nothing was seen on approach hope they  discover rings in departure images but we won see those til sept ish tick tick tick especially want to see more of charon at high resolution and that departure crescent on pluto official raw image page makes it hard to do that but bulk downloader works with my version new version of my preview of the new horizons pluto image data set colored squares not yet released as raw images beautiful mahli mosaic from illustrates geologic history in marias pass nasa social media strategy is genius and kinda maddening by am amused this morning by watching people argue with venus expert about how earth like venus is yay has released mvic color pluto  charon not overlaid on higher res lorri great making of story by feat pew pew pew pew pew so good to see chemcam back in multi shot action very cool comparison of pluto hummocks to st helens landslide by exploitcorporations yes  seen this great work which used screen cap from nasa tv because the full res version hasn been posted while waiting to be on updated my version of raw image page nothing new today when you are done watching soyuz dock and if you can tear yourselves away from sharknado3 watch me on one of my favorite things about twitter is watching space event together with my space tweeps lt appreciate posting this after all of last week rhetoric about completing solar system work with pluto what in the world are tholins has your answers of course we are an international society join at my first day in the new planetary society hq so nice may actually be able to come here to work rather than hide in my home office name hayabusa2 asteroid target awesome art by bifurcation in my twitter feed this morning while many people follow still talk about plutoflyby or are cracking crisprfacts jokes today cassini is taking snapshots of saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits today cassini is taking snapshots of saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits our community can do better than this claudia alexander memorial fund has raised only 5k help her leave legacy similar process darkens dark areas on iapetus callisto and probably pluto after what saw on pluto and ceres today just booked my room for dps2015 new horizons encounter plus one week weird and wonderful images from the pluto system yowza just realized that by now earth should  received more frames to add to image mosaic of tombaugh regio  been asking for dawn at ceres haze in occator crater some incredibly fast guest blogging work by this new raw release of charon is from first look clearly they are letting out the raw versions of images that have been press released the two high res pluto images released today mosaicked the mountains of tombaugh regio lol srsly meanwhile have just sent my eighth email in my quest to get the image tombaugh regio mosaic that was shown at friday press briefing this is the 2nd raw image to be released from first look downlink there should be more similar ones coming aha new pics of nix and hydra caption features and today and tomorrow cassini is searching for clouds on titan today cassini is taking snapshots of saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits trying to figure out if it okay to repost brian may stereo pics of pluto he hasn responded do you know an extremely thorough report on lessons learned from lightsail from ha that great point my version of the raw images page has been updated current status eating chocolate chip cookies until my clock tells me can have wine yes but individuals who produce derivative works from public domain data retain copyright science terminology is important omg just realized that 3d picture of pluto 2x2 mosaic was posted full res click for large image pictures of comparable quality of styx  kerberos have not been returned yet and won be for some time made pluto system family portrait from the raw images released by today this is one of my favorite earth images from planetary spacecraft galileo departure movie brian may 3d image provides our first downsampled glimpse of 2x2 global mosaic on pluto that the mission hasn released yet tease dscovr mission releases first epic global view of earth more to come in september my response to this is to use photoshop to upsize image and tell the designer found higher resolution version follow for live tweeting of press briefing from elon musk about recent launch failure teeeeeeeaaaaaassse updated my visual catalogue of raw plutoflyby images with new ones released this morning here you go courtesy of gordan ugarkovic the stereo separation between the two raw global pluto images is not much not sure if there meaningful 3d here yay while was distracted by pluto the team seems to have okayed trying to use the drill again my morning so far today think  write about ce philae what going on wi pluto oh now can make that im eah squirrel love this new dscovr image of earth so much subtler colors feel more real than previous blue marble pics yet reefs still electric blue mostly lost in jpeg compression artifacts but still nix team version was shown friday not online yet that question that the team is asking too there are nested dark regions maybe inner one is basin they posted the first look pictures amateurs how fast can you make 3d pic of pluto 32 km pixel on incredibly thin crescents the opposite phase view of these while wait for pictures spending time making another model since gave first one away new horizons awaiting the data in which explain what going on with raw image releases also today cassini will spend 17 hours observing saturn and rings today cassini is taking snapshots of saturn small inner moons to monitor their orbits while was gone my husband taught my daughters to play settlers of catan lt it is raining inside lax terminal so they  sending us on an unorthodox route to baggage claim almost not quite finished blog post about new horizons raw image release while in flight stay tuned for now going home lt amazing how often turn blog post into an excuse to dig through for voyager data plutopalooza poor nozomi planetary exploration always does that that why into it each mission has its own website and they do great job explaining basic whys and hows of their missions glass of port with is an acceptable way to cap the week doesn look like  get blog entry done today not all images from briefing are on web and no raw images to fill in with  tired didn get chance to ask when weekly raw pic release would start was hoping for after press briefing but nope stern we are moving to weekly releases of raw image data omg pluto plains look like arctic polygonal terrain bolden we have visited every planet if you want to get technical we have visited every planet and dwarf lt someone needs to tell him tweeting may be very difficult as having trouble with nasa hq wifi and my hotspot has bar may just be taking notes it an awesome shi and leo just gave me one lt lt lt and now to hurry to headquarters for the press briefing in less than an hour that was fun even ran into joe palca on the way out while getting ready for and presser caught up with what images have been released  what left these are amazing aww miss my daughters in the meantime will be on at 11 00 et along with mission operations manager alice bowman no new pics on this morning they must have shut down raw image pipeline background stars are very faint but they  there easy to see in long exposure images at charon is bigger than ceres but still good ceres not much denser than charon know why so ellipsoidal people if tweet contains link and you have question about the tweet please try following link first to see if it answered there and send you greetings from pluto going to be on tomorrow with alice bowman yay talking about latest new horizons picture of charon oddly familiar ack it looks like the charon image retweeted got un posted again third time the charm hope nice yes think this looks lot like the new charon image there it is new image of charon think that image wasn ready for prime time yet so unretweeted karl hibbitts just told me all about the awesome mise spectrometer being developed for the europa mission it going to be hard to wait just had nice chat with and have new appreciation for how complicated it is to get pictures from data pete spotts just said to me  seen surf titan shirts want one that says ski pluto internet please make this happen checked in and aww ceres lt pluto also interesting that they get to use km today cassini is imaging saturn moon bestla to study its pole direction shape and color checked with media team and confirmed no new images planned for release today personally think this huge mistake back to any remaining media covering new horizons the coffee maker is up and running and brought fresh milk new horizons is talking to big dish in canberra right now downlinking another mvic color image of pluto  charon overnight the new horizons team should have received pepssi  swap data plus high resolution frames across charon and here is akatsuki thanks cassini is now at apoapsis greatest distance beginning its rev 219 21 day orbit of saturn orbital inclination is almost forgot my raw image page is now up to date as of health downlink asked several people today about plans for new horizons image releases tomorrow as of 6pm there were no plans for any releases tomorrow hero first look at pluto and charon baffling in very interesting and wonderful way it  be in my blog post coming soon just came up with completely crazy idea about pluto pointy mountains finished with type type type now to switch to post post post the original schedule had them kicking media out of this building at 5pm but now they  saying 6pm tick tick tick type type type spencer summing up the whole briefing well it baffling in very interesting and wonderful way argh they didn answer my charon forming impact question all the images for the briefing are now onlne at applause in the room that the heart is now informally named tombaugh regio charon has way more interesting geology than any other similar sized world we  visited 45 30 km is size of hydra somebody convert hydra dimensions to km for me can math right now 28 19 miles sociological note you can tell who are bona fide media in the room because they do not applaud at press briefings re the yellow squares are the likely location of the high res images that were downlinked today dunno if they  be released now same here wish knew which website to look at for the images when they get posted betting but know for sure feeling little shaky think it just too much adrenaline and not enough calories gobbled granola bar image press conf in 20 minutes hammel think there any game changers we need out there we  looking for improvements on existing technologies not miracles hammel tech needs for outer solar system exploration miniaturization lightweight materials power power power hammel there is future for ground based and space based obs of trans neptunian objects but want more ground truth than just nh at pluto hammel there is an underground sentiment that we do need to get back to the outer solar system but it so hard hammel we have every confidence that the mission will write an excellent extended mission proposal and that nasa will fund it heidi hammel what we  seeing here is as fantastic and amazing as what we saw in the voyager flybys of neptune and uranus systems hersman we will hibernate during later mission cruise because it good for the spacecraft and it lowers mission cost hersman everyone  seen is smiling hersman the scientists got all the data they expected to get hersman every indication is that the spacecraft is in great shape that bodes well for the departure phase and the kbo mission hersman we have enough power to take data and transmit to earth at same time also no moving parts to point instruments chris hersman mission systems engineer for new horizons will update us on nh status now follow and for detail classic jim green just love talking about what we do it so exciting it really is emily lakdawalla planetary evangelist for the planetary society ama psa people who hassle me today will be muted or blocked neat phone home signal arrived 8min 20sec before exact 50th anniv of mariner mars flyby 1965 jul 15 01 00 57 utc there are new images on the ground from new horizons the world will see some at press briefing today at 19 00 ut 15 00 et 12 00 pt today shirt is the long goodbye by dan rule arrived at apl too late for coffee service so have fired up loaned keurig media it in room k225 before forget need to thank for defending my seat in the press briefing room so could run off to skype to live behold its icy visage revealed in all its glory so happy that is space enthusiast but for now it time to pack up and return to my hotel sorry didn have much time to answer questions today am doing reddit ama in space tomorrow at pt 12 et 16 ut new horizons phones home after pluto flyby signal was received at 00 52 37 ut 20 52 37 et 17 52 37 pt it too long for twitter to explain exactly why that probably planted child question about the extended mission was so funny bowman gnc engineer reported that we were on track which means we were following path laid out for spacecraft bowman we didn have any autonomy rule firings and what that means in layman terms is that teh spacecraft was happy bowman tell your children to do what you  passionate about do something because you want to give yourself that challenge bowman can express how feeling to have achieved childhood dream of space exploration pretty overwhelmed at this moment the science team starts the crowd chanting alice name alice well gee fountain going to make my remarks brief the science team wants to go look at their data think they would prefer drink sleep stern have never been one to underplay the significance of this mission standing ovation for alice bowman the next downlink we are expecting is first look it begins at 09 32 ut 05 32 et 02 32 pt and ends at 10 59 ut 06 59 et 03 59 pt in the house tonight are some children who were born the day new horizons launched they are now am not clapping for every single planet in our solar system it makes it seem like we have finished we have not am not clapping for every single planet in our solar system it makes it seem like we have finished we have not very happy leslie young just told me they got pepssi data along with the telemetry holy crap it all worked mean knew it would work but still holy crap it worked standing ovation in the auditorium pi mom on pluto we have healthy spacecraft we recorded data on the pluto system and we are outbound from pluto thermal repos nominal al temperatures green power system is nominal hardware is healthy propulsion is nominal pressure is 176 gnc is nominal all hardware is healthy and we have good number of thruster counts ssr pointers are where we expect them to be which means we recorded spectra autonomy is very happy to repo nominal status rf nominal had to stop tweeting to go hug people yaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay we are in lock with telemetry lock on symbols its still alive no matter what stand by for telemetry we are in lock with carrier switch the cameras naaaaooooo shoooooowwww usuuuuuusssss misssssion controoooooool this is the last thing want to hear about right now it is impossible to follow twitter right now all my columns are scrolling like slot machine don actually have any reason to be concerned about calling home just 10 minutes until we  supposed to hear the signal crossingfingers crossingtoes crossingeverything some food  vino nice view outdoors friendly conversation and recharged and ready for tonight phone home feel should write blog entry about first impression science but it will all be wrong tomorrow anyway so procrastination is good ve made modification to what to expect post tonight nasa tv feed begins at 00 30 ut 20 30 et 17 30 pt mcnutt possible that nitrogen atmosphere being sighted early may have been hiccup because of what the solar wind was doing at the time okay think have been working too long and it is too late in the day for me to understand fields and particles science mcnutt we have been awarded 31 hours of director discretionary time on chandra to look for solar wind charged rays ralph mcnutt is talking and and are not here to take notes so will have to serve user zld has morphed the mvic color image onto the lorri grayscale image these may have been up for while already but just noticed that the last opnavs are on the raws page poor welp seem to have come to the notice of certain just told him we have lot of the solar system left to explore charlene christy it wonderful having waited all this time to finally get to see charon showalter we  not really finished searching for sixth moon of pluto but if it there it really small awwww via is now on the spacecraft pointing at earth to phone home signal takes hours to get here here recording of my segment on on today worthy monty python reference christy you start with charlene and you take the ene off and put an on on according to jim christy the correct pronunciation is sharr rhymes with bar on like the word on an epic panel beginning now pluto moon discovery team jim christy charon hal weaver nix  hydra mark showalter kerberos moore is recalling the mariner approach images of mars where scientists published about the 500 km crater at nix olympica jeff moore wouldn say charon is as interesting as pluto not that there anything wrong with it spencer it perfectly fine moon poor geology team has been too busy talking about the images to media to sit down and study the geology spencer is explaining how thermal segregation may explain contrast between light and dark terrains on pluto as on iapetus and callisto much of the geology team on new horizons were grad students together on voyager so they like to give each other hard time basically yes spencer we have the opportunity to fine tune when high res images are played back depending on what we see in lower res images john spencer this part looks like mars if you ignore the temperature and the composition and everything else as grunsfeld likes to say science never sleeps aside science would like to sleep now here are the informal names being used for dark spots suggested by public campaign organized by lot of the time that how science ideas happen someone poses question you have to think of an answer fast and there it is am having parallel processing problems in my brain so please just read streams guess tweet takes the place of the traditional phone call these days atmospheric science result cathy olkin from the ground we knew there were lot of different colors on pluto but we never imagined anything like this here is the mvic color data hope pics will make it online soon charon pole is red the not planets all those round worlds we  visited to scale my twitter silence is because of interviews group pictures etc but had chance to tell jim green what thought of what grunsfeld said going to be on shortly about 40 pdt to talk about yes look what churyumov gerasimenko looked like up close can even imagine what others are like as always there an xkcd for that think that the most dangerous possible thing to say about pluto flyby that with it we  somehow done with the solar system we  not word oh this agree with how about the whole rest of the kuiper belt eris makemake haumea sedna orcus would just like to take moment to thank and for your awesome tweeting  notetaking from the panels and now have to stop listening to pluto geologists for few minutes to go do standup for the bbc plutoflyby bonnie buratti we have been monitoring from earth what we now know is the heart on pluto for 60 years bagenal pluto looked remarkably like mars much better than mars though fran bagenal says it unlikely new horizons will reach interstellar space it going slower than voyagers just had an opportunity to congratulate marc buie on the quality of his pre new horizons hubble maps of pluto rosetta looked at pluto too it seems that years of being mom and months of working at home during home remodel have prepared me well to tune out distractions new horizons best look at pluto before close approach found the full res am working on posting it still haven found the new picture in full res on website only the low res version on instagram bowman we were 72 seconds early stern our nav predicts came out to 70 km closer to pluto than aimpoint well within spec plutoflyby dwayne brown is passing american flags out to the panelists right now all images are being returned with jpeg like lossy compression we will get lossless ones eventually stern to my eye these pictures show younger surface on pluto and much older and more battered surface on charon plutoflyby grunsfeld to bowman what is the actual data rate think it lower than 56k bowman yeah we wish it was 56k plutoflyby asked if the new image showed evidence of hazes or clouds stern replied he looked and hadn seen those or plumes yet xkcd what if what if new horizons hit my car joel achenbach asked my question so figured ask question for all you pluto weather fans out there as sitting in front row lot of photographers are shooting over my laptop with pluto image on it to desk stern  bowman there is lot of applause happening but it feels premature until we hear from new horizons again since it faq it will be 13 hours until we hear from new horizons because spacecraft is too busy scienceing to talk to us right now press briefing coming up momentarily but still 13 hours until we find out whether new horizons survived flyby or not closest approach plutoflyby they are playing the final countdown no there is not this is happening outside the press room and off nasa tv and not sure why bowman we had lot of activity in the mission operations center last night with dsn antennas uplinking to new horizons 3am 30 mission operations manager alice bowman getting prepped for her tv appearance my first impressions of this image there are so many different things happening on this world my shirt for today is explore planet pluto classic from astro gear will do my best to answer questions today but lot of your questions are answered in this blog post the next expected downlink is the phone home it begins at 17 52 pt 20 52 et 00 52 ut and ends at 18 09 pt 21 09 et 01 09 ut four dishes in two locations at the deep space network are uplinking radio signals to right niw see that squiggle below nhpc that represents the slow trickle of bits that  build our best ever image of pluto amy barr and geoff collins paper about predictions for pluto interior structures and surface geology via the next downlink called health starts at 19 23 pt 22 23 et 02 23 ut and ends at 20 15 pt 23 15 et 03 15 ut omg you guys this capella science new horizons video is awesome via think am going to be live on global bc in vancouver in about 10 minutes have been told that the wow wow color image is supposed to come out at tomorrow morning briefing too tweets most of the good quotes first but once in while gotta tweet one faster to keep her on her toes pluto continues to surprise us and charon is surprising yay is here to tell us what wow wow means choice of target will be made in august think course correction in november extended mission approval in 2016 it should hit the ground at 23 07 edt but no idea how long it will take for public release predict morning no one more charon image 2x as good as what we  got one pluto that is way better should be coming down tonight mcnutt atmospheric escape rate will tell us something about how this planet has evolved in the last billion years we think maybe spotted in the wild on pluto hat another newhorizonsbingo square you  killing meeeeeee pluto minus day very first new horizons pluto encounter science results pluto diameter composition atmosphere thanks for the primer on atmospheric escape processes all right we actually got some science news in that briefing so going to shut down twitter for bit to write about it briefing over stern these first compositional measurements show us that the polar regions are compositionally very different from the dark regions stern people love turning little dots little points of light into planets and writing new textbooks from scratch stern particularly for children pluto is dimunutive and they  diminutive there an association there stern there no single reason people love pluto there lot of different reasons grunsfeld pluto is capstone of our solar system exploration and also it opening up new realm stern explains color data is much more expensive in terms of bits to get it to the ground which is why more lorri pics have come down cathy olkin promises new color images tomorrow blerg yes stern people on the team talk lot about how surreal it is that we  actually finally here but the energy level is electric stern new horizons cruise is not record rosetta set record but rosetta had many flybys so didn seem like interminable road trip stern sdc hears all the thruster findings so we have to change the squelch level so we quiet down the racket from the thrusters eris is bright and super far away hence cold when it is much closer to the sun it prob has pluto like atmosphere stern we tested techniques we used to determine pluto diameter on charon and got the right answer radius 602 603 km yes let stern was interrupted by siri on somebody phone just now note has just been passed to grunsfeld who passed it to stern who nodded and passed it to fountain whatcoulditbe understand you have to put miles on graphics for americans but for love of pete why can you also put metric measurements stern we detected escaping nitrogen before expected either escaping faster than we thought or mechanism is different than thought stern pluto radius is 1185 km 10 it settles the debate about the largest object in the kuiper belt stern it sounds like science fiction but it not fills out one of my newhorizonsbingo squares psa will not respond to any questions comments about pluto planetary status that is least interesting thing to discuss at plutoflyby they  simulating pluto temperatures in press room and shivering but if put on jacket will cover my awesome shirt spacegeekprobs schenk there lot of speculation flying around team right now but we recognize most of it as being ephemeral plutoflyby schenk the dark spot at the pole has definitely triggered lot of interest on the team think any clear answer has emerged yet paul schenk speculation on dark pluto squiggles eroded crater rims fracture networks related to diapirism mystery answer wow there reporter here from buenos aires international media are even more international today plutoflyby no live webcast but there are many people tweeting including me there are the pics  been waiting for all times edt add hours for utc subtract for pdt plutoflyby overnight should  received its fail safe  downlinks including the last optical navigation pics of  good morning from plutoflyby central my shirt for today is spaceships someone combined flyby graphics with animation of new horizons pluto flyby awesome my space shirt for today was inner space by rick crane  camille chew ok need to go to bed pluto pluto pluto in the morning does anybody else think that those charon chasms look little miranda ish after dinner tipped the guitarist at restaurant he asked why we were there told him we were all journalists covering pluto flyby me leo enright look at charon am at dinner with other members of the media who are all cursing about charon picture being released now that it for media events today can haz beer now stern there will be images released tomorrow and ones tuesday that were downlinked monday on wednesday it starts raining data asked stern whether they had data yet to confirm idea that small moons are rotating chaotically he said not yet haha had to put down the microphone in order to talk with his hands to explain pluto magnetosphere stern alice instrument rex and swap have not yet detected the system but that what we expected leisa has been detecting  for weeks no green was talking about south pole aitken basin sample return lunar farside chance to sample moon mantle team after stern dissing of geology today you better put one of your geologists on panel soon vote jeff moore alan stern divulges the fact that he took geology twice and quit because he found it too much memorization and not enough math alan stern for both pluto and charon we see evidence that these are worlds that have at different points in their history been active several people have said today they expect first signal at 20 53 edt on tue which differs from nasa media predict of 21 02 oh man metric system question we should  put that on the newhorizonsbingo card hersman  engineer is tracking fuel consumed by the gram and it exactly on track that tells us science obs are happening as planned chris hersman mission systems engineer is giving us an update on navigation status tl dr everything is great weaver we just had some data come in today and it already looking spectacular but it going to get 180 times better weaver we  already seeing lot of similarities with triton it almost eerie weaver every morning at 8am team has science meeting getting disciplinary teams together to present new results no flyby is complete without idle speculation hal weaver help to bridge the gaps between the scientists and their science speak and the engineers and their engineering speak dang none of these are lining up yet newhorizonsbingo huge loss that women of new horizons photo makes me happy but also sad about its lack of ethnic diversity we still have lot of work to do asks green if he was referring to proposed discovery trojan mission green says no he has not looked at discovery proposals yet asks about next kuiper belt object to visit green answers we may not have to go so far could visit triton or trojan asteroids green nasa position is simple we do not care what this object is called it an object well worth observing oh god why you gotta ask about planetary status somebody asks green about extended mission be willing to bet that the team is not focused on that at the moment jim green is now tearing up as he remembers and honors claudia alexander jim green new horizons is really the mission we wanted all along and we finally got it jim green director of planetary science at nasa shows off pictures of his new grandson plutoflyby now randy gladstone is telling us about atmosphere observations and are live tweeting media center is already hopping for flyby many international space journalists already here reporting for duty from kossiakoff center don have time now to answer lots of new horizons questions but will be working later today and will answer more then any dots you see between pluto  charon in nh pics are either stars in background or cosmic ray hits on detector because lorri has no color filters it is panchromatic color data will be provided later by different instrument zooming in to pluto and charon pluto god of the underworld an amazing and inspiring blackandstem scientist has died the world is poorer place tonight since lot of people are asking they didn colorize the latest pics of pluto because the color data they have is old thus very low res pluto has stopped looking like mars and now really really looks like titan but half the size knows how to par taaaay plutoflyby omg pluto you guys its pluto get email almost forgot my spacey shirt for today is family portrait by updated my new horizons data page looking good but my fingers need break will work more on it later am making thing today cassini is performing distant observations of saturn moon ymir to study its pole direction shape and color my former boss always disagrees with people who say this just had lovely dinner with bunch of pluto people and we spent most of it talking about the geology of venus while pluto could have visible clouds atmos is very thin what we  seeing here must be mostly or all surface pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto right now have to choose between writing blog entry about visiting before pluto flyby and going back to visit people cool during conjunction we couldn use stereo to monitor sunspots so curiosity helped thanks to dan durda for this set of six simulated views of down its six axes new horizons update live on nasa tv right now two more brief mission updates philae makes contact akatsuki to perform course correction exposures for these images have been 100 milliseconds lorri is very sensitive camera new public pluto pics are making nice use of the lorri field of view well framed folks and small friend of mine helped out with this week pluto themed video for insight into how science process works check out stream today he live tweeted work on dust in mars atmosphere maybe tomorrow will finally have time to play with awesome new pluto pics but also have curiosity update to write toomanyrobots facetime is the greatest thing ever for traveling parents because of the lovely weather in maryland think will be going through two shirts day therefore three mission updates trouble for at ceres new plan for coming together time for my daily bump of this post got questions about the plutoflyby have answers  links to resources here hi some of the folks who are bringing you plutoflyby news do they look ready for next week they are ready not everything is about pluto just got the lowdown from elizabeth turtle about awesome camera she developing for europa mission greetings from pluto plutoflyby want your name in space join the planetary society we put our members names on all spacecraft that take them my first day at for plutoflyby today shirt is yay space by just past plutotime on united on my way to cover the plutoflyby would pick one of the or reachable objects the search team discovered with hubble yes but we  use nh to explore another kuiper belt object first then the edge of solar system like the voyagers yes the heart matches the bright region at 180 degrees seen in hubble pics comparison we know yet but it could new horizons will take enough pics on approach to look for clouds see if they move ganymede is bigger than titan but titan has very puffy tall atmosphere also ganymede pic is higher phase work in progress 23 large non planet solar system objects to scale with each other since everybody keeps asking the same questions think  repost link to my what to expect article once day for the next week my experience of today snafu flight super delayed watching chinese student group play jenga at gate thans for your guest post on how to explore pluto in google earth blarg made calendar mistake and now have to bail on speaking engagement agreed to long time ago still so fuzzy but yet so awesome it standard literally has years after the flyby to make sure it can get every bit of data down all data that takes from this point will be transmitted at least twice  could be  transmitted think  been on the internet too long my first thought on learning both and have computer probs today was conspiracy new horizons mission update starting on nasa tv momentarily cassini will also observe enceladus south polar plumes today today cassini will image saturn fainter rings including the ring ring and methone ring it got too hard to explain to the kids why going away for 10 days so now just telling them going to pluto packing for plutoflyby cannot decide between professional look and my large wardrobe of jokey pluto demotion shirts will bring both 6yo just spent 20 minutes noodling on the piano and it was actually very melodic lt she said piece was called moon lighting moonlight song blockity block new horizons triumph for space advocates by ha also now hungry the whale and the donut mmmmm donuts lots of conversations among space media about timing of new horizons events the hour one way light time delay makes this confusing dear pre travel anxiety you  not helping me get ready for this trip go away more than 2000 rosetta navcam images for your enjoyment mon new horizons stop distracting me am trying to write post about one of the other umpteen space missions out there right now two way data transmission happening between new horizons and the big dish dss43 at canberra right now according to there should to be tv update right now but not finding it during the flyby cassini will shoot two large mosaics of titan surface covering xanadu and fensal aztlan cassini is now flying past titan at relatively distant altitude of 10 953 kilometers new horizons back in action after safe mode event ready to resume encounter science question for new horizons folks fountain said nh command load would begin tomorrow 12 45 edt that earth received time right am now laughing because leo enright asks version of his current question at nearly every pre space event press briefing stern pluto is not triton it looks like it has more complicated story to tell us gah got disconnected and missed min of the briefing stern we made choice to suspend science until the beginning of the encounter command load on july in order to focus on recovery fountain now explaining the anomaly taking notes  will tweet details in moment calling in now to listen to press briefing about safing event you can listen at video editors take note dan durda has produced really nice turntable animation of spacecraft the upshot conse has heard no signal from yet xkcd solar system questions debating whether should even attempt to pay attention to any missions other than for the next two weeks get email should be on bbc radio live shortly to talk once wimbledon highlights are over looks like going to be on bbc national radio at 10 50 pt 05 50 ut 06 50 bst talking baout safing event what relief nasa new horizons plans july return to normal science operations icymi new horizons is in safe mode it worrisome but spacecraft is talking to earth  should be fine panic screen cap of communication with canberra shows downlink is carrier only uplink is telemetry today cassini cameras and spectrometers are studying saturn south polar aurorae cassini is now at the periapsis closest approach of rev 218 187 830km above saturn clouds near mimas orbit we know yet the most common reason for spacecraft to go into safe mode is cosmic ray hit to electronics new horizons enters safe mode 10 days before pluto flyby if recovery is quick no serious science impact crap crap crap new horizons team responds to spacecraft anomaly today cassini is imaging titan not for science but for engineering the polarizing filters need calibration awsome is now applying itself to the task of monitoring new horizons raw images pluto is synchronously locked with charon so natural choice of zero meridian is sub charon longitude mars exploration rovers update opportunity phones home after conjunction healthy ready to rove today cassini will check to see if titan has any visible clouds today cassini cameras and spectrometers are studying saturn south polar aurorae pluto progression third to last pluto day before encounter pics processed by my vacation is almost over seem to have 1256 unread email messages debating whether should return to work or just run away today and tomorrow cassini will continue its observations to measure the shape and spin state of kiviuq my poor husband has taken me to paris for our anniversary yet here am on my ipad late in the evening checking out latest pics of pluto triumphal arch over venus and jupiter today and tomorrow cassini will be imaging tiny outer moon kiviuq to measure its shape and spin state cassini is now at apoapsis farthest distance from saturn beginning rev 218 an 18 day orbit with an inclination of departing for weeklong pre pluto vacation usually avoid the internet on vacation but think  have to watch pluto grow bigger hey ia2015 attendees was there anyone at meeting who be excited about this job please encourage them to apply my latest for about those cool new color osiris pics released today subscription required interesting these rare color images use similar wavelength combination to mvic what to expect when you  expecting flyby planning your july around new horizons pluto pictures version found at half price books in texas toboldlysew new horizons briefing beginning now at oops corrected link for the new horizons briefing short new horizons mission update and media briefing should begin in few minutes at visiting my dad in north texas found beautiful very large insects in his yard flooding is good for bugs guess am so excited can hardly stand it new kind of world being seen for the 1st time two of them pluto  charon friends working on massive pre encounter post what questions would you like me to answer holey moley go lightsail hooray for pluto in color go mvic go new horizons while cheering go pluto go charon cassini images of tiny polydeuces trailing co orbital of dione processed by daniel machacek today cassini is observing distant crescent titan holy cow these are great seats letsgorangers little image processing fun with cassini awesome new dione pictures before  after transient hot spots on venus best evidence yet for active volcanism just waking up to find out the charleston shooter has not been found how is any black person in america supposed to feel safe today also today cassini is looking for aurorae at saturn south pole today cassini is observing distant crescent titan ve been asked to blurb book the book is great but finding it super hard to write blurb that doesn sound stupid whoa the europa mission really is moving forward from concept to development philae is awake what next for the comet lander scientific mission would anybody attending the ia2015 conference be interested in writing guest blog about it for the planetary society this the problem is not too many phds it telling graduate students that only useful work is in academia my daughter wants to buy fantasy books with horses for her friend 9th birthday any recommendations think about this if you  ever tempted to refer to our manifest destiny among the planets ia2015 by zapping asteroid icarus arecibo can measure the effects of general relativity on its orbit zapalltherocks follow ia2015 today for reports from the inclusive astronomy conference no question this was the highlight of my day yesterday thanks today cassini is observing the lightcurve of distant tiny albiorix ok done playing with raw new horizons data for bit who else is giving me raw data today ah cassini is my daughters are marching around the kitchen improvising song in pretend spanish laughing so hard they are farting lifewithkids this is my strategy not joking bjorn is much better at wringing sense from teeny images than am charon orbit is actually quite circular it looks elliptical because new horizons is approaching from an angle because there no obvious clue in the images as to where the barycenter is no landmark leave that as an exercise for the viewer translation from academese ran out of time the pluto animation just made is so cool working on the blog post now hopefully the kids will let me finish while they eat dinner cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from north to south at position near rhea orbit beyond the ring niburu is my favorite of these because there really could be large planet out there that we haven found yet as cassini departs its close flyby of dione its optical instruments are imaging the crescent moon try to share my love of space with many of the people who pass through my house to work on it but not all those conversations go well cassini is now flying just 516 kilometers above dione it not taking pictures instead radioing earth studying dione gravity field on approach to the 4th out of close dione flybys of the cassini mission it is shooting frame global mosaic ack forgot to tune in to new horizons show on nasa tv live now while close to saturn cassini optical instruments will look across saturn limb cassini is now at periapsis closest approach of its rev 217 188 520 km above saturn clouds near mimas orbit cassini is now speeding past tiny polydeuces at 34 757 kilometers away although very close best pics will be crescents 14 pixels across cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from south to north just outside dione orbit torn between going to bed and playing with new horizons images okay maybe just couple pictures dear very glad you made it home safely but will sorely miss your spirit  vision from space somewhere my older daughter has learned to say no offense right after she criticizes her sister and it is super annoying thanks for having me on to talk about for almost 10 minutes will recording be available for download somewhere cassini optical instruments are now observing rhea from 220000 km look for pics soon at ok time to figure out what the news is about beyond yay it awake cracks knuckles geologic maps are large part of the reason got into geology come what may what if what comes is information that indicates it not safe to launch visit for story about my favorite interplanetary cartographer phil stooke today cassini is studying the light curve and color of distant tiny moon tarvos now watching wonder woman episode in which she trying to convince scientist to listen to the opinions of an indigenous population has updated lt would like to take moment to thank the fates that did not wait to wake up until say july 13 yaaaaaaaaay philae today cassini is keeping tabs on the positions of saturn small inner moons cassini is now watching as enceladus passes in front of mimas look for raw images soon at ok nerds need your recommendations haven seen any if the superhero movies made in the last 10 or 15 years thanks to mark showalter for adding system barycenter as selectable target in the rings node pluto viewer for me they are and we tried it when they were and and they were not interested just watched star wars with my girls for their first time lt ve spent good chunk of the day struggling with how to align pluto charon images when know where the system barycenter is oh in the next room where my daughters are playing with their can go to sleep know where my gun is today cassini is keeping tabs on the orbits of saturn small inner moons not long enough exposure for stars to be visible only 100ms this is the greatest image of pluto and charon ever taken saying this will never get old taken 20 hours ago my 6yo perspective on the world is forever fun everything on fire then now it flooded meanwhile still working on the 1000 best cassini images of hyperion every pic better than 5km resolution more recent pics already released in raw form here it takes the team time to process them ever closer to ceres image analysis by me for subscription required whoop and these pics are week old we already have even better views than these pluto is place folks descrambling this image was more difficult than it initially looked lightsail have really tried not to be luddite about the new jpl website design  really tried to like it but just don curiosity update sols 978 1011 into marias pass chemcam back in action solar conjunction okay it after 4pm and haven even started work on finishing my curiosity update post gosh darn it jim bell is giving history of solar sailing acknowledging lou friedman leadership in developing and launching cosmos lightsail lightsail press briefing in 10 minutes today cassini will study the light curve and color of tiny moon hyrokkin from distance of 14 million km kids are in bed so back to playing with the 1000 best cassini images of hyperion didn quite finish my update today but my map has gotten even prettier hopefully done tomorrow win hooray our maps of pluto surface are now as good as our maps of mars and venus circa 1900 glad you liked it received an email criticizing my improper use of word email contained several grammar  spelling mistakes  poor word choices grade having lot of fun playing with mars panoramas with app and it not quite fully deployed will lightsail finish deploying before the atmosphere drags it down wait and see hey look it me in cassini follows its crescent titan observation with the first of series of saturn storm watch observations over the next days cassini is now observing crescent titan what the heck happened to the day blergh scheduled their ldsd briefing on top of our planned lightsail briefing so we  have to delay ours ve been working on descrambling the partial pic of lightsail just few little sail bits can figure out oooooh man that did not look good ldsd there goes the drogue ldsd good burn ldsd omg can believe they still have video from the ground what an awesome view ldsd go ldsd press conference tomorrow june 17 30 utc on lightsail progress gigantic near space air jellyfish has been released ldsd one of the best things about media events is the commentators usually know when to be quiet and let us listen to operational chatter dscovr arrived at l1 between earth and sun is preparing to monitor solar storms headline seems kinda wrong tho ha amateurs are tracking lightsail sails deployed they estimate orbit decay june 14 day it just about plutotime in los angeles right now cassini is now at apoapsis farthest distance from saturn beginning rev 217 an 18 day orbit with an inclination of just added another pluto demotion shirt to my extensive collection this is hockey team can support go teamrovers thanks for hooking me up at planetary society hq today filming super fun random space fact with and of my kids can wait to read this book by sociologist of space science seeing like rover ve said it before and  no doubt say it again oh my god you guys korra is so good used to take people on journey with spirit to mars with some help from me eep four hours since this post and we  had more updates from but still no beep from lightsail planned post on cassini hyperion pictures this week but fell into rabbit hole downloading archive pics  dunno if  get out today cassini is studying saturn its ring and titan from high phase angles wow the first data release is already out that was super fast not sure how to use any of it though now imagine this happening on red dusty plain under pink martian sky new horizons has very little extra fuel but astronomers finally found reachable kbo targets hubble last summer leo enright is my favorite irish space journalist david perlman is my favorite 95 year old space journalist no fortunately it not hazard to new horizons chaos is in their rotation how they spin not orbital motion showalter numerical simulation of nix appearance as seen from pluto shows its wobbly motion its pole even flips having looked at the briefing materials have to compliment mark showalter on their clarity great scicomm showalter we were looking for dusty ring around pluto which we didn find but we did find kerberos year later found styx the delay in start of pluto conference gave me time to change miles to kilometers in diagram ll probably live tweet pluto briefing but won write blog entry as wrote briefly about it two years ago are you casual musician who never learned music theory let explain it to you with ice rich compositions charon 1200km and pluto 2400km are definitely large enough to be round nope teeny dots really are best ever images of pluto it really far away and not very big pics will get better no you  downloading 1000 cassini images of hyperion instead of writing the articles you should be writing it  never get old new images from just hit the web here the best image of pluto ever taken today cassini will study saturn and its ring at high phase angles help my kids are learning that they can delay bedtime by asking me to explain science things thank you short exposure seconds means few or no stars visible moons smaller than charon also too dim very few more details on pluto with helpful graphics by telecon planned on surprising observations of pluto moons 1pm edt wednesday lol was thinking exactly the same thing or maybe hyperion has something to hide on the other side sand on mars has pesky way of collecting right at geologic contacts also sol 1001 whoa cassini is now flying 34 286 km from hyperion grabbing two high resolution mosaics hyperion will be at 70 phase cassini is now approaching flyby of hyperion its best since aug 2011 and the last close encounter of the mission cassini is now looking at crescent enceladus and its plumes today cassini optical remote sensing instruments are studying saturn south polar aurorae haven been tweeting space today because the whole family is at amherstreunion cassini is now studying crescent titan when viewed from this angle its upper atmosphere lights up cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from north lit to south inlit sides at distance close to rhea orbit while close to saturn cassini is using its radio dish to study saturn deep atmosphere at microwave wavelengths cassini is now at the periapsis closest approach of its rev 216 188 590 km above saturn clouds near mimas orbit cassini is now crossing saturn ring plane from south unlit to north lit sides at distance just outside dione orbit quoth my angry 8yo sometimes there nothing bigger than my annoying little sister you haven been reporting too long but maybe you and need break space nuts is an protoflight model the same as engineering model or is it something different mon lightsail talk to us wow the rocks the layers the veins the contacts between them this is geology sol 995 eeep it gonna need hard reset mon lightsail talk to us niebur right now we  looking at 45 flybys of europa nobody on panel will be able to tell me what want to know which is nitty gritty details about camera capabilities  emailed pis camera package consists of color wide angle camera and monochrome narrow angle camera like with messenger  new horizons europa the nasa press release on europa instrument selection is live niebur magnetometer and plasma instruments will allow us to take an mri of europa find out how deep how salty europa are delighted to be among the first to congratulate for her selection as pi of the next outer planet camera instrument europa europa instrument selection briefing beginning now omg every kind of electronic communication method am on is asplodey with europa instrument news right now sending mental hugs to all my friends in the space community whose proposed europa mission science instruments do not get selected today today cassini optical remote sensing instruments are mapping saturn atmosphere isro moots ground station in vietnam today cassini optical remote sensing instruments are tracking clouds in saturn atmosphere pause your life for six minutes and watch the sun set on mars simulation by whoop what great spot for to take 360 degree panorama part in stereo very proud of my daughters for their hard work  awesome bharata natyam performance today lt oh joy wanted to start my day with unsolicited advice from man at gas station today cassini optical remote sensing instruments are studying saturn south polar aurorae as cassini continues to study saturn clouds enceladus mimas and epimetheus will race across the disk my new kitchen is fully operational mwahahaha tons of fun with the latest ceres image releases from dawn anybody out there interested in physical copies of the journal icarus from 2009 2012 it gt 100lbs of paper looking for good home cassini cameras are now studying saturn clouds and titan is putting in an appearance also made this today ceres ceres ceres stay tuned for cerean cereal cerious blog post tomorrow tonight again am applying all my mad graphic design skillz to attempting to print spice jar labels  lost round one will prevail just created file called dawn camera schmutz technical terminology ftw will be posting on this eventually actually all the way down the instrument selection for nasa europa mission is going to be announced on tuesday well isn this pretty little hitheater of geology that curiosity has driven into it super guppy via think the cup of coffee that drank this morning was defective guys for four months have not had kitchen and the remodel is just about done and am baking lightsail pie cassini is now observing half phase titan look for raw images at in one or two days last comment from today launch webcast pucchchchhchchshhh spaceship noise atlasv lightsail this photo wants to be meme ified nye do they call this mission control agid yes they do nye geeking out that so cool lightsail atlasv and that it for live portion of the webcast by request of the air force but will be on webcast shortly live video of staging separation from space will never ever ever ever get old atlasv afspc5 lightsail come oooon geeet offfff thaaat laaaunchhh paaadddd wow that atlas is slow without solids go atlas go 37b go lightsail go cubesats go go go go go go 10 just about time for the always thrilling launch poll watch live afspc5 atlasv lightsail customer united states air force atlasv afspc5 webcast has begun watch at lightsail mission control with steve agid commentating lotta hashtags to watch for launch today afspc5 atlasv more likely to contain news details lightsail x37b atlas5 more excitement the air force has announced that afspc5 x37b lightsail launch window opens at 15 05ut 05pdt current status drinking port and downloading quantities of mro ctx  hirise data asonedoes not sorry for being happy story from woman in tech about choosing the path that right for her lol you  thinking of voyager voyager is moving slower  hasn left the solar system twelve times yet voyager particle counters are counting lot of particles is it approaching heliopause quoth my 8yo like to read books with no pictures because they take my mind to different place  then want to punch my sister two months from pluto guest blog by paul schenk scientist on both and missions lightsail launches tomorrow some time between 14 45  18 45 ut the air force hasn told us exactly when yet we  know in the morning blergh messed up ut time conversion deleted tweet relaunching while it awesome to be hitching ride to space with the air force 37b there are associated inconveniences follow and for on the spot reporting on lightsail launch activities ok folks quiz time what mission took this photo answer in few minutes woohoo my latest cover article for is out everything you wanted to know about today cassini optical remote sensing instruments are studying saturn south polar aurorae this is good mnemonic device thanks cassini is now at apoapsis million km from saturn beginning its rev 216 it is 18 day orbit at an inclination of degrees opportunity been mountain climbing for long enough that forgotten that most of meridiani planum looks like this ve been looking at spirit images just came across pic taken when she got stuck at troy theressomethinginmyeye is this enough rock layers for you curiosity sol 986 these coconut like rocks dark outside bright inside are some of the weirdest things  seen from opportunity very pregnant me with the engineering model of the at jpl in march 2009 girlswithtoys selfietospace would like to tag every single awesome sciencey girlswithtoys photo with selfietospace and send them all to space on lightsail this is lightsail ride to space today cassini is observing saturn distant moon paaliaq to study its light curve wow this landscape curiosity sol 986 processed by aki docio 15 ways nasa earth science benefits you that you see by unseen latitudes of comet churyumov gerasimenko revealed featuring 3d model lol you know that the tiniest pixels are where the alien bases are hiding just enhance your pixels my latest for curiosity on the threshold of another age of mars subscription req there will be two week gap in taking new images but lots will be returned in next weeks how does this even happen this photo was taken by new horizons only 16 hours ago it took almost of those hours for data to travel to earth we are now just 10 000 shy of our lightsail goal guess we better get to work on stretch goals so cool the sun final sliver over the horizon in curiosity image from mars having one of those evenings where physically in the same room as my husband but my brain is on mars he puts up with lot holy cow we  already gotten to 62 000 out of 200 000 goal on our lightsail new horizons has now spotted every one of pluto satellites at least the ones we know about going to space on lightsail you can too selfietospace support the planetary society flight by light with lightsail back us on woohoo reports that chemcam software will be updated restoring its ability to autofocus hahaha awesome to explain by convention titan mountains are named for mountains from middle earth want to play with space images for living research scientist in image processing job available at caltech yep enceladus is still enceladusing cassini image taken yesterday this week cassini is using all cameras  spectrometers to study saturn atmosphere  aurorae all the space image design work do is way easier than it was to get these dumb printer labels to line up right today cassini is observing saturn distant moon kiviuq from distance of 85 million km to study its light curve cassini is now crossing the plane of saturn rings from north to south beyond the ring bit inside the orbit of rhea cassini is now observing crescent enceladus from 360 000 km photographing its plumes cassini is observing polydeuces km wide moon orbiting in the trailing lagrangian point of dione from 45 000 km away marc rayman is our guide to the awesome engineering on icceres live now marc rayman then panel discussion on small bodies missions icceres near periapsis cassini is observing dione and crescent tethys with infrared spectrometer and camera cassini is now at periapsis for rev 215 at 187 910 km above saturn cloud tops near the orbit of mimas cassini is now crossing the plane of saturn rings from south to north within the ring at distance bit outside the orbit of dione due to ion engine failure procyon will not fly by an asteroid thanks to and for working to make some sense of the end of progressm27m reentry this evening why is my very important presentation not writing itself cassini is now flying 721 kilometers above the surface of titan the flyby will shorten cassini orbit by days join us will be moderating the panel discussion with love this comment on martian sunset post the oddest kind of homesickness farsickness the jundland wastes are not to be traveled lightly curiosity sol 855 lesson in how how stratovolcano is built want to say big thank you to the random women who broke an unresponsive security gate at parking garage so pile of us could escape curiosity update sols 949 976 scenic road trip and diversion to logan run check out work on the team stunning photos of sunset on mars lots of space stuff happening today but am spending the morning watching one of my kids get cavities filled poor kid she doing fine lots of space stuff happening today but am spending the morning watching one of my kids get cavities filled poor kid she doing fine thought was just about done writing my next curiosity update but just fell down another rabbit hole mars is full of them week daily images now being released by enjoy week daily images now being released by enjoy wearing my calavera vader shirt today for revenge of the fifth and cinco de mayo la fuerza es fuerte con este this just struck me as an especially cool view of curiosity at work on mars need better way to display rover panoramas in blog posts at present have no way to do justice to this humans have created new type of sediment found worldwide in the geologic record icymi wrote an important essay on the structural isms that squash the souls of minorities in science today cassini will perform several astrometric observations of saturn small moons for the next few days cassini will make occasional observations of titan leading up to may flyby farewell pics by messenger my latest for about our fleet of martian orbiters subscription required images from via we know is gone but take one last listen just in case because space engineers are nothing if not thorough haha that is awesome full frame image no curiosity drive over that little pointy rock messenger last image meters per pixel in crater jokai in mercury far north when messenger crashed it weighed less than half what it did at launch more than half its mass was fuel every drop of which it used bye bye messenger thanks for the adventure looks like will indeed be in dental chair as we lose contact with for the last time first time  ever seen someone else made one of my spacecraft plastic canvas designs going to sit vigil over messenger as much as possible today but have dental appointment during its final descent this interactive feature on messenger collision is pretty terrific by now this is fittingly celebratory and smashy bashy tribute to messenger the big dish at madrid is downlinking messenger data right now get it while it hot today is messenger final day once it crashes we  be down to planets with active orbiters new horizons sees surface features on pluto begins raw image release hrm not convinced that this exercise in stacking aligning and animating pluto images was productive one can any of my astronomy friends identify the stars in the background of the long exposure new horizons pics haha must be jealous of they released nice new picture today alan stern explains geometry of the latest new horizons pluto charon animation woohoo the new horizons mission has launched raw images website omg omg look at this animation of pluto and charon new horizons press briefing beginning momentarily today released more than 1000 navcam images of the comet through september 2014 just made hotel reservation in maryland in july to be in the middle of the action when encounters pluto new pluto images to be released tomorrow be excited but not too excited they  still be small lt pixels still comparable to hubble holy wow just stumbled across the voyager io departure data set fanfare it super guppy cassini is beginning its rev 215 with couple weeks of storm watch observations of saturn this doesn look like much but it cool pleiades and hyades seen by curiosity from mars view of mercury at meter per pixel that is like amazingly high resolution cassini is now at apoapsis beginning its rev 215 28 day long orbit of saturn
