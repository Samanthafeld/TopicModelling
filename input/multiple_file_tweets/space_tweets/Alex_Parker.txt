could go into enabling technologies too bipropellant engines for exploration with extremely small satellites beeess debating what big new thing to try next start lab build an instrument surprisingly was not called out as proposal weakness despite being very green pi have good team simplex mission selections were made by nasa flicker won fly this time sadly will work for jelly tots there lot of pressure to write dynamic papers and give engaging talks in science not all who do good science can do those things laboratory work isn second class planetary science that debatable what not here to judge it your life just make tacos in it never change boulder one of these years in going to make it to an astronomy on tap event hear there are even otters flpr flpr see the world from above they said push spaceship into orbit they said poor rocket really wants to go to space can help but think exterminate exterminate when see these lined up like this my phone will autocomplete coffeecoffeco to coffeecoffeecoffee and coffeecoffeecoffeeco to coffeecoffeecoffeecoffee barista oh alex is my boyfriend name me smile noncommittally barista you are not my boyfriend me pays for coffee can even remember why made this the other night good morning colorado have subaru will travel meep today purchased device that adds moisture to the air the northwesterner in me is very confused sitting at the astronomers table at this wedding every wedding should have one favorite new car buying strategies after all the new challenges of the pluto flyby it nice to spend day in my comfort zone just deleting the background universe after all the new challenges of the pluto flyby it nice to spend day in my comfort zone just deleting the background universe after all the new challenges of the pluto flyby it nice to spend day in my comfort zone just deleting the background universe could be observational effect hour coding in line at dmv nope maybe projection issue two hours of math nope overlyhonestmethods anybody have access to journal stats that would include the distribution of accepted paper lengths particularly for apj aj and icarus just heard dmv staff member describe what being an organ donor means to horrified looking non fluent english speaker when you boot your workstation after being on travel it amazing to see people doing what they have always wanted to do truly excelling at it and being recognized for it somebody bunny on maryland bench after rainstorm tells sad story with no words best cell phone case ever belongs to the incomparable evening denver it good to be home bees on final leg of return trip to colorado after 40 days away for plutoflyby almost home disclaimer any semblance of morning cheeriness may simply be byproduct of hypercaffeination maryland seems determined to prevent my departure currently in the longest airport security line have ever seen there may need be cheese puffs special session at next planetary science conference right after the bees session after over month in maryland for the plutoflyby just when thought could go home my flight was cancelled wrapping up the first post pluto flyby new horizons science team meeting with wedding new horizons taking last long range images of pluto now we prepare to target new distant world in the kuiper belt newest highest resolution pluto map is now available in google earth last full day at pluto central new horizons has already traveled so far since flyby that looking back pluto appears no larger than jupiter currently appears from earth it 11 15 do you know where your penguin is the way redacted instrument calibrates itself is relatively ingenious thingsactualscientistssay reluctantly alright let do the sanity checks thingsactualscientistssay ve been pretty caught up in pluto lately but earth is alright too non pluto paper submitted tumbleweed blows by at pluto central had nightmare last night where had to take another job at redacted center office situation was so bad postdocs were kept in stairwells the haze particles are very small ices flowing around the periphery of tombaugh regio swirling around obstacles and into the landscape the full halo image is lower resolution but lossless some of us stayed up to wait for the late night downlink when this image came down many of us dropped what we were doing and just stared pluto farewell to new horizons brilliant hazes softly backlit by the sun fun fact the enhanced color took few minutes to process and render while the natural color took over 12 hours to process and render why we send machines most detailed yet global mosaic of pluto in true and enhanced color also if you liked the enhanced color image you should really watch the new horizons briefing today and prepare to have your mind blown world of exotic ice landscapes painted in pastel our enhanced color image of pluto what even while talking space robots crunching data from one space robot submitted budget for analyzing data from another space robot finishing paper on future space robot enhanced color image of pluto and charon assembled by both pluto and charon fit in single mvic fov lt earth earth twin earth like earth ish chopped liver gt in one night myself  spencer took new horizons data and created this image calling it this series has jumped the shark calling it this series has jumped the shark soyuz on approach to the iss sharknado3 suddenly wild appears sharknado3 the one atmospheric scientist in the room is glaring at the screen right now sharknado3 these ads seem to be tailored to sharknado3 audience yes the test paper is not dissolving on that soap but would it stop shark but that not even physics actual scientists  sharknado3 argh sounds like ceres is fuming about pluto and charon pluto pluto pluto dark mountains soaring over bright plains of twisted ice close up views of pluto smaller moons on nix and is hydra another ducky theorists this week every time someone says that data from space mission is too low resolution for print the team penguin sheds single salty tear you know you  made it when ndgt team shares your work on tumblr with illegible attribution to tune of 200k notes that is all today ran photojournal profiling the new horizons science and operations teams really enjoy doing graphics work and data visualization but glad do it professionally it remarkably thankless really enjoy doing graphics work and data visualization but glad do it professionally it remarkably thankless drink to forget beeeeeees heading back to pluto central woman stopped me in the street is this the way to the pluto palooza tiny child with tiny voice summarizes the mood here pwuuuutooooooo plutopalooza at apl today come by and say hi plutoflyby plutopalooza zeno donut lt pluto and charon lt pluto the geese are now more isotropic thingsactualscientistssay does this make me co orbital bump given the stuff working on today have psa kids study your geometry it could help you explore new planet one day some interesting questions and answers about the carbon monoxide spot on pluto in this thread plutoflyby if you have qs about the carbon monoxide on pluto suggest you ping he spotted it in the data salt in wound vs its the thought that counts discuss streaks are frustratingly similar in size to the jpg compression boxes we have to wait for lossless data to confirm look at the earlier false color map of pluto see how the left half appears different color than the right it great seeing all your reactions to today releases we  been puzzling over all these findings and it has been so exciting caption contest brian may alan stern and cody the ggi team penguin plutoflyby life uh finds way met brian may this morning and then asked if we could take photo with him and stuffed penguin just gave my first irl interview since the start of the pluto encounter glad caught up on sleep bit last night photometrists to action stations thingsactualscientistssay so anybody get the today the new horizons team got new bumper stickers guess should buy car funny story about that interview was teeny bit sleep deprived and very used to seeing hank green talking on computer pluto and charon on the edge of everything plutoflyby this is amazing my charon inspired by on the eve of plutoflyby talked with at about our mission to explore the worlds at the edge there was nine hours between this new data coming down from the spacecraft and the press conference sciencing as fast as we can this vast mountain range lies within the borders of tombaugh regio the heart of pluto the small moon hydra cashew made of ice the size of hawaiian island mountain range on pluto rising kilometers up out of bedrock of water ice here that full resolution image of charon all ice ash and pastels it is hard to focus on pressing work when images like that mountain range on pluto show up on our data servers pluto heart is now being called tombaugh regio so very fitting mountains gandalf hope you all are catching this charon canyons are vast spent all morning working on getting that charon image colorized hard to get subtle colors right are you ready for charon you know why excited about that picture of hydra it similar in size and brightness to typical kuiper belt object zing at the nasa new horizons press event you should all be watching on nasa tv why is everyone particularly alan stern so excited in those plutoflyby team pictures from this morning one idea what day so who wants to fly by classical kuiper belt object new horizons ai made it through the system without an upset the instruments collected and recorded the expected amount of information so many nominals new horizons made it through the plutoflyby and is communicating with earth we are in lock this is it made graphic of the solar system which turned into puzzle and subsequently solved with magic best typo  seen today color enchanted images to describe our enhanced color images of pluto and charon beeeeeeeees upper right bugs what kind of bugs beeeeeeeees enhanced color images of pluto  charon our team made to highlight compositional diversity less than 12 hours ago  processed this image now the potus has tweeted it now is showing our team enhanced color image of pluto so much going on in this image pluto heart is broken plutoflyby will grundy is showing our team enhanced color image of charon the dark polar spot is red plutoflyby moment of the pluto flyby should write blog post on the colorization process pic we stayed up all night making is now part of the family portrait there something in my eye pluto flyby the final countdown has started to play at 25 seconds the team and me reacting to the big reveal this morning nasa tv view of mission ops empty but for janitor vacuuming if that doesn speak to our space robot autonomy know what does half an hour until closest approach to pluto small team me  john spencer were up until 3am to get this ready for you only one hour of sleep last night worth it good morning all who wants to explore pluto today time for some sleep everybody go to google right now this happened plutoflyby pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto skype with and pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto pluto the history of discoveries of worlds beyond neptune plutoflyby alkdjw kgh aldvn lasmf al new horizons has answered question that has been open since 1930 just how big is pluto schedule for today rsync rsync rsync rsync rsync rsync rsync the composition team penguin can see through time and spectral cubes the puns have begun plutoflyby plutoplutoplutopluto pluto plutoplutopluto it pluto eve almost there plutoflyby fireflies charon is beginning to look spectacular with fresh rayed craters and series of vast chasms don fully understand what motivation science communicator could have to suggest we get over pluto on the eve of its exploration earth observatories mapped the stars beyond pluto so new horizons can navigate far from home my god it full of accurate no sleep till pluto huh that odd so like yeah eeeeeeeee our best and last direct view of the spots on pluto deconvolved with care just for you new horizons will image the darkness shrouded southern pole of pluto in moonlight for small creatures such as we the vastness is bearable only through love carl sagan suggested by beautiful field guide to the solar system from the why hello there outer solar system falling ever closer toward pluto pluto scientists for the last nine years of new horizons flight hello 000 new followers hope you are enjoying pluto can long time followers fill them in on what to expect when things return to normal moons can be in stable orbits out to about half the hill sphere larger separations are possible but usually not very stable suspect it will be hard for team members to avoid making whoosh sound effects during the flyby new horizons cares very little about pluto gravity though flying through the system so fast its trajectory is hardly altered by pluto the region around an object where that object gravity dominates over the sun is called the hill sphere well this is amazing wait second that no moon pluto and charon floating together in front of the deep dark there was spy in our midst at pluto central today ash pale frosts on wine dark plains the epic of cody penn the wayward blue penguin is currently playing out at pluto central hey hey hi yes you hi pluto amirite hi do you lt pluto plutoflyby where would your house be on pluto go find out with our newest pluto map in google earth more pluto bunch of us got up at 5am this morning to process this data as fast as possible redacted co is from california he melt if he got rained on it makes me happy every time my code successfully finds and draws little circle around charon all by itself the deep space network is currently trading bits across the solar system entire expanse infinitely faster than the nyse is trading shares me today working on it plutoflyby as of this moment there is only oneplutoday left until plutoflyby the dark feature on pluto is being informally called the whale by the team ice weasel didn stick new maps from pluto including way to explore pluto in google earth today the sun will rise on an unexplored world for the last time the final full pluto day before new horizons flyby begins tonight stood with the team all waiting for 1100 to become 1000 on feed from the deep space network despite the long light time delay the plutoflyby is going to be legen wait for it dary unrelatedly eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee six days twenty three hours forty seven minutes to pluto drinking spiced ale spiced with old bay it is confusing spaceship hats have you ever tried to recite list of memorized numbers while someone is reading different list of numbers aloud to you current science team mood all singing along to bon jovi wanted dead or alive stay safe bellingham people in light of the new horizons red planet images of pluto corrected this xkcd how team communication is going at the moment with used the new pluto color maps to colorize high resolution images from new horizons lorri camera here movie never thought be plutonian cartographer but here are new horizons first maps of pluto made the color map two graphics made are on the front page of right now five year old me is having moment the dance choreographed for new horizons plutoflyby all maneuvers are performed with hydrazine rocket thrusters there is full moon on earth roughly every 29 and half days full moon hasn shone on pluto in over 20 years nine years to cross the solar system plutoflyby nine years to cross the solar system plutoflyby when the wind blows softly in just the right direction it carries the distant plaintive call of lone ice cream truck pluto charon brightness monitored during new horizons approach by clearly show distinct lightcurves pluto in color from new horizons hi resolution images of pluto processed by and colors processed by me one advantage of looking pretty ragged in the morning barista has started just throwing extra shots into my lattes falling toward pluto at 30 838 miles per hour plutoflyby happy pluto encounter month then put your little hand in mine there ain no hill or mountain we can climb leapsecond current status spaceship the top photos for the hashtag sbag kind of tell the whole story right now this is just to say what winds are sweeping across those distant terrains quiet and ancient plutohaiku in just two weeks time pluto cold northern summer will reveal itself plutohaiku in few hours pluto shadow will sweep across the earth and dozens of scientists are waiting in the shadow path watch plutoocc2015 fireflies with hand held iphone are hard today was elon musk birthday that that sad confirmed that we have had non nominal flight oh really loss of vehicle that was bad oh rocket continuing to rocket rocket rocketing rocket rocket was promised mineral analysis fresh donuts fresh pluto data fresh supreme court rulings good day hey neat got thing let look at some hubble data swear sometimes the conversations around here sound like we are preparing for the jump to lightspeed pluto bus was success currently on the pluto airplane then the pluto rental car facility shuttle then the pluto rental midsize sedan poor moose just wanted some imported chocolate from bayleaf on pearl made the bus to pluto encounter with 45 seconds to spare well this is awfully cute happy solstice for my hemisphere friends enjoy the summer hemisphere friends think of it as getting into the spirit for pluto flyby packing for pluto encounter let do this something something academia figured it was time to brush up on my geophysics in advance of the pluto encounter so watching the core pleasing moon jupiter and venus think garlic may have been hunted to extinction to make this dinner ping the light is alright packing up the bar kit for the month long trip for pluto encounter question is do pack the pluto shot glass saturday agenda make pancakes get suits pressed science pluto first near true color movie of pluto and charon by and there silver haired woman in sky blue dress doing tai chi whilst holding broadsword prop on the banks of boulder creek oh boulder if you want to follow new horizons team member on twitter keep list of all that know of here hangout starting momentarily if you haven already watched this ten times you probably should today  be participating in new horizons google hangout with  others re discovery of redacted on redacted are you familiar with this am very familiar with this do you believe it this time no it fairly large object tried to fit it in cubesat once it didn really work thingsactualscientistssay this is stunning and beautiful new horizons reconnaissance of pluto and the history of planetary first encounters so we  off by factor of about 10 23 in fact almost exactly avogadro number divided by root pi thingsactualscientistssay there was hummingbird moth at my window tonight this is your periodic reminder that hummingbird moths exist few things taste more like summer wonderful chose to charge me an hourly rate for the time spent standing in their line to return car here you go made you comet pancake everyone all yay back to work philae jeez get the poor little thing coffee first at least everyone all yay back to work philae jeez get the poor little thing coffee first at least and some moving water pretty decent haul of wildlife today mountains mountains for future reference if you ask for permission to use adapt my artwork and say interesting tell me more that does not mean use it seem to have baked three dozen peach puffs oh dear ping today in python development planetary mapping tool tiny an astronaut just retweeted me meeps we  just over month out from pluto now made some while working on maps ssw 387 redacted canadian those moose are dangerous man half mile out of town they  take your wallet and just leave you for dead finally got business cards some contact info redacted there fixed your headline patch pushed to live site color images of io europa reviewed tno target list supplied new figures made revised paper draft to coauthors partial chute deploy there the rocket new on robotshaming seriously robot give us the keys robotshaming those ear things look particularly fancy when the go flying off at the end ve seen better flops in the world cup robotshaming oh door can even robotshaming new and improved high latitude and pre dawn behavior for plutotime calculator balloons are fun way to trick the earth atmosphere into doing all the work of lifting something to the edge of space balloon going supersonic in just wait no hrm my normal launch play by play doesn really work here go balloon go the is busily chatting with two of humanity most distant explorers and happy sunday for nationaldonutday three hacked maple bacon poutine pineapple caramel  strawberry shortcake there goes the weekend recent efforts what color is pluto how well lit is pluto what does pluto taste like tbd plutotime is why was rendering those pluto terrains the other day plutotime the moment just after sunset on earth when the illumination is similar to pluto right away you can see this sort of swirly pattern making it pretty clear that magnetic fields are involved thingsactualscientistssay twerp caught few lightning bolts 240 fps clouds lit by lightning apparently spring has happened bunny imagine world orbiting star deep in intergalactic space there are no stars in your night sky just the faint light of distant galaxies exiled stars explode far from their homes deep in intergalactic space discoveries by tonight smoked curried tofu on my grill peak boulder achieved creek rendering some synthetic pluto terrains for couple upcoming projects short clear and to the point summary of the orbits and rotation states of pluto small satellites we are just six weeks away from the pluto encounter enjoy the design in this csa graphic but it does make me want to shout look out moon it right behind you just got request for permission to include one of my graphics in an elementary school textbook on art runs away and hides seriously have nightmares about being responsible for this kind of screwup it might not be the bolder boulder but it was lovely evening for an easy five miles the rains have been busy painting the walls weirdly this paper is not writing itself hello colorado am going to get rained on oh on flight back to colorado going to meditate now so might nod off you  taking nap try to fancy it up currently gluing pieces of cheese to crackers with apricot preserves dispensed from foil tube whilst flying feels slightly astronaut ish so unless am mistaken am going to be in colorado for over three weeks take that for whatever weather omen you wish it to be the whole new horizons missions ops team just made an appearance applause wait who driving the spacecraft very nominally our sequencing was different back at jupiter my life just sounds like science fiction now skinny lorri noodles part of complete flyby the life of mission operations manager is always intense 3415 days 18 hours and 13 minutes flight time so far 46 days 22 hours and 36 minutes to go pluto is getting awfully big in our viewscreens should call you czar czar is fine thingsactualengineerssay space robot logistics are complicated 47 days 23 hours 39 minutes redacted usgs software feels slightly dystopic where have all the good spice kernels gone 48 days off to the last pre pluto new horizons science team meeting lot will change between this meeting and the next one the traffic near my apartment seemed lot less automotive than usual this morning terrible form is terrible given that this winter shows no sign of ending there line for my 12 55 space robots talk at denvercomiccon2015 drd all these dudes in long blonde wigs and just wore my hair tied back tiny terrifying arya stark cosplay is terrifying not in my upper quartile of talks but really wonderful crowd the art of science begins quetzalcoatlus denvercomiccon this might be the worst bus crowd  seen in years drinking beer shouting cursing throwing stuff at people not in their group youths on my way to denvercomiccon at 25 today  be talking the art of science there will be data visualization disk usage for user redacted is over limit story of my career there is an alarm in one of my storage boxes that goes off every morning at 10 41 am but never long enough for me to find it it has been tad rainy think the proximity of new horizons to pluto and the frequency of fits of giggles around the swri offices might be correlated it right behind you was coincidentally listening to drive it like you stole it when watched this oddly appropriate how am preparing for this summer you ask this sunday  be giving talk at the denver comiccon contrasting space robots in pop culture versus planetary exploration oh ground based survey data have not missed you let just make this as easy as possible who wants to see rocket race today atlasv x37b launch vs 2006 atlasv launch vs srbs it okay buddy lots of us have hard time getting moving in the morning atlas5 go go go liftoff lightsail atlasv found transit map of the solar system the message getting from twitter today is that coloradans are water soluble darn no simplex mission discussions at the upcoming sbag meeting just discovery mondays are for irresponsible applications of mcmc techniques very much like living in colorado but do miss the sea hello again colorado here for week and day this time typical weather in san francisco today weather in san francisco elephant seals elephant seals like the beach still my favorite back and forth this week cc still my favorite back and forth this week cc reading papers used to be fun know right you  seen few things as pathetic as crowd of astronomers emerging from the morning session to find that break coffee hasn arrived yet space space one of the things we are doing for the exoplanets for one welcome our new exoplanet overlords little jealous of the microlensing community for getting to use the phrase planetary anomaly with abandon huh this really doesn show up well on this projector but there have been references to winning nobels on every single day of this conference kind of forgot this about astro meetings my mom suggestion for what the bright spots on ceres are they are stadium lights for the world ceres applause hive mind what are your favorite animations visualizations of historic planetary missions particularly the earliest missions there are some weird things that have been showing up in kepler lt biggest understatement so far in hotwirediv hope not crowding your space but this week asteroid alexparker is making its annual close approach to earth colleague after stealing water pistol from another partygoer all do is win win win squirts everyone at table well can walk up 14 er yeah sure if you start at 12 oh wow at hotwirediv attendees are being hotwired pluto charon styx nix kerberos hydra anybody else home we  only weeks from pluto now and we  finally seen all of the known moons in the system note for creating movies of astronomical image time series to avoid looking like your target is in boiling water psf match your frames surely the most amazing transients are gamma ray bursts gamma ray burst researcher now hearing about the neutron star interior composition explorer nicer an ray space telescope to be mounted on the iss hotwired4 note to all conference organizers in theater you quickly learn that the worst thing is candy wrappers in the audience do not provide and now hotwired4 kicks off with eric bellm and the zwicky transient factory this week in santa barbara for the 4th hotwiring the transient universe meeting hotwired4 all the transient astrophysics hello again santa barbara berkeleyffiti so has europa on tap they saw teamoutersolarsystem coming from mile off oh in bookstore mom to small child honey why you pick one book that you really want to read small child but there are so many nobel laureates aren big on working for the weekend hello again bay area it been while just printed poster about my proposed cubesat mission the printed image is larger than the actual cubesat enlarged to show texture we need tiny wind tunnel to make tiny comet dunes could just get bunch of grad students with straws science they  so fluffy can say canisterized satellite dispenser without imagining toy capsule vending machine but filled with tiny space robots today is my last day as postdoc to celebrate had donut donuts are standard issue on friday mornings think the nomenclature just isn settled mean there no decree from the iau saying yea verily thingsactualscientistssay at these pressures life as we know it couldn exist at those pressures rocks as we know them couldn exist day work week on pluto would last more than an earth month friday day work week on pluto would last more than an earth month friday so picture the scene radio astronomer is monitoring for frbs is getting hungry but doesn want to leave their post finally rushes the frequency of team communication in all caps seems to be inversely proportional to new horizons distance from pluto mars is weird more at 11 autocorrect is not fan of coffee resets counter for days since  made my best margarita ever to zero

troubling symptom of writing nasa proposal autocorrect has taken to assuming ordinary words are acronyms and capitalizing them for me just spoke to my hoa president about recent raccoon attic incursion she asked what did for living mentioned my cubesat proposal has now passed 25 000 words and 55 pages of text not including the budget or supporting documents generally when stars interfere with observations of solar system objects delete them currently the earth is interfering hmm get off my photo manipulated lawn bzzzzzzzzzzzzz huh someone flying drone outside zzzzzz whump sounds of

feel like this is not the archetype of insightful sports commentary bird birds birding birdly birdish birdest wonder who is cheering for today this might actually work worked late at the office the universe decided to let me know what terrible idea that was all tiny space robots should come with deployable selfie sticks and gopros right just going to point out am watching archer while all are telling me where can find high energy proton beam fridaynightscience anybody have high energy proton beam they can lend me have detectors that need testing why is redacted planetary scientist but you all know who it is so not nice to people thingsactualscientistssay all want is space qualified large format gt 50 fps high qe detector that produces lt 1e of readnoise is that so much to ask my
