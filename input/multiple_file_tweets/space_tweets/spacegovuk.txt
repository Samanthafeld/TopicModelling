most collisions with more numerous untracked objects ground based systems track 10cm and larger in low earth orbit there have been number of known collisions hazardous objects and development technologies to mitigate divert but yes natural processes erode hide evidence of impacts over time currently just telescopic surveys to detect potentially hazardous objects but we are identifying technologies needed to divert gt 20 000 trackable diameter gt 10cm gt 500 000 untrackable but lethal to satellites 10cm gt gt 1cm gt 10 000 000 lt 1cm how many space debris all size are in earth orbit

tune in same time tomorrow wsw2014 only minute left helen taking final few questions now wsw2014 tte2014 slept well and did not recollect any dreams now sometimes dream of being in space though do you dream differently in space from wsw2014 tte2014 every astronaut wants to return stay for months to make it worth the cost and risk of launching without missing people on earth you spent 7days 21h 13m in space if you had the opportunity to return and stay longer would you wsw2014 from study something related to science or engineering at university keep fit and enjoy variety of leisure and social activities and the river snakes darkly through it all wsw2014 tte2014 think esa will work directly with china russia and america for human and other space flight but will continue with its own satellites what do you see the esa doing ten years from now from if reliable and cost effective esa will hire on commercial basis esa and other european ventures are developing rockets of their own how will europe compete with cheaper newer private rockets wsw2014 tte2014 from ion drives are not capable of this yet but if you need fast delivery and chemical engines assist it could work tte2014 could an ion drive go from leo to mars for delivery of cargo like sma1 wsw2014 from my advice to is to make the most of opportunities for looking out of the window wsw2014 tte2014 what advice would you give to before he goes to the iss wsw2014 tte2014 loved feeling weightless the views of earth and space and seeing the experiments work but most of all enjoyed the crew team spirit what was your favourite thing about living in space wsw2014 tte2014 humans should continue to explore while minimising their impact on new places and that includes going to mars wsw2014 do you think mankind should go to mars wsw2014 tte2014 fear is of the unknown my training had been good so there was no fear and claustrophobia was not an issue wsw2014 tte2014 did you ever feel scared or claustrophobic when you were on the mir space station if so what did you do to cope apart from the beauty of the earth the lack of life minutiae and not seeing clear borders between countries is refreshing how did you feel the first time you looked back to earth from space wsw2014 tte2014 carried out wide range of experiments from growing potato roots and protein crystals to testing new materials for spacecraft what activities were you involved with while you were in space wsw2014 tte2014 learning russian was definitely the hardest part but as all the training was in russian there was strong motivation wsw2014 tte2014 what did you find was the most challenging part of your training wsw2014 tte2014 decided as soon as knew of the opportunity heard an advert for the job on my car radio on my way home from work in june 1989 when did you first decide to become an astronaut wsw2014 tte2014 did chemistry degree required was degree in science engineering or medicine with practice at work now you want phd as well what academic qualifications did you do and which were required from wsw2014 tte2014 most food is inside packets or tubes so you smell it but even so taste reduces probably due to body fluid shift and mineral loss why does your sense of taste get worse in space from solid state quantum processors exist though they do much yet and there is big investment say years for something useful how soon do you see electronics industry moving to quantum computing and beyond the electron wsw2014 from if leaving keep your contacts and be prepared for serious effort to get back up to speed but leaving opens the mind so it is also good do you have any advice from your experience to support older women in tech ie encourage to return not leave from printable food still needs basic ingredients but it provides more choice once printers can react chemicals they will be more versatile what are your thoughts on the future of printable food lab grown meat have you tried either what did you think ion propulsion is used for some spacecraft interplanetary and for satellite orientation it is unlikely to be useful for launches can full body ion propulsion work from wsw2014 nasa has minimised space work with russia but esa and nasa both need russia for transport to iss china will be important in the future how do you see the future of the esa nasa co operation with the russian space agency given recent setbacks from wsw2014 using technical equipment and applying science in factory is similar to what astronauts do in space though the views are better how did you make the transition from those industries to the space program from wsw2014 what astronauts like to eat varies often we like stronger tasting food in space because the sense of taste diminishes know sense of taste can change in space so which candy tastes better which worse from tweet the expert with helen sharman is live send us your questions now wsw2014 only 15mins until our tte2014 session with helen sharman get your

of interesting things q11 what is your favorite constellation henry barlow mca wswq  a10 if they happen to look good that nice bonus when it comes to spaceships in science fiction anything goes a10 in the case of real spaceships function is much more important than style and the design is purely practical q10 where does the inspiration for spaceship designs come from a9 it easier and quite feasible technically to do it wswq  a9 yes believe that men have been to the moon find it much harder to believe that such an enormous conspiracy could be successful q9 do you believe that man really has walked on the moon or was it conspiracy could we go to mars a8 we are top of the league we take every game as it comes if we get promoted then next year we will crush the puny tynesiders q8 what are the chances of cardiff city being promoted this year a7 the pictures are great and it in these filaments that new stars are born wswq  a7 the amazing filaments of gas and dust in our galaxy that the herschel space observatory has found q7 what the most fascinating thing you  seen in space ramez rubbani mca wswq  a6 but most of the energy comes from burning hydrogen which is very clean fuel it just forms water a6 not enormous few tens of tons of co2 for launch and some pollutants which disperse rapidly q6 what the quantity of green house gases and air pollution produced in launch to iss a5 different wavelengths tell us different things a5 we look at the light emitted by stars planets and galaxies not just light we can see with our eyes but also light at other wavelengths q5 how do you know lots of things about the universe elliot cardno st leonard of wswq  a4 it will be far too hot for life to exist earth but it won happen for about five billion years a4 the sun will expand rather than explode becoming red giant star and engulfing the earth in its atmosphere q4 is it true that the world will end by the sun exploding when might this happen wswq  a3 it much easier to work at lower frequencies wswq  a3 thz radiation is strongly absorbed by water vapour in the atmosphere and so is not suitable for ground orbit communication q3 whether or not thz communication from leo to ground is achievable at reasonable power levels a2 which still remains the best film about the universe and our place in it a2 first became fascinated by space through the moon landings and the film 2001 space odyssey q2 how did you become interested in astronomy stephen mca wswq  a1 dark fluid theory is very speculative we can say if it has any validity let alone any uses a1 we have no idea about how to travel faster in space without using known physics q1 could dark fluid theory lead to faster space travel or is energy mass involved too great for us to make use of it we have batch of questions that you have mailed in so we  start off with those if you have more questions tweet them at us wswq  welcome to our tweet the expert hope you  got your questions ready for matt griffin pi for the herschel space telescope wswq  40mins left until our 1st tweet the expert session for wsw2012 have your at the ready 15 00 16 00bst wswq  celebrating the use of space to enrich teaching and learning in the uk blog post from world space week image of the day 1960s such stuff as dreams are made on nice video on the sun too nice piece on newsround about the amazing world of satellites watch it here newsround are doing weeks worth of space reports and big space survey we have an expert each day of wsw to answer your today is prof matt griffin space science tweet us your happy world space week everyone do you have anything planned to celebrate next round of galileo nav satellites uk built payloads are on the soyuz in kourou ready for launch on 12 october visit the public exhibition on horse guards parade december 10m high space dome showcasing the impact of eu space prog on daily life plenary is space community focussed december david willetts mp antonio tajani richard branson business development fair dec focused on growth in downstream space apps market user led approach in 11 thematic areas target audiences are non space sectors registration now open for ec space solutions conference hosted by the uk space agency london december european space solutions event december 2012 tonight wish to lose myself among the stars latest blog post for by emma lord what do you think register your interest in our mx train like an astronaut programme today your school can get fit and meet astronauts send us your early for tweet the expert later this week to make sure they are answered wswq  only have few so far start tweeting in your questions for our tweet the expert event during world space week tweet the expert world space week 4th 10th october let everyone know about this fantastic free opportunity image of the week astronomy photographer of the year
