animation today was taken by satellite at the l1 point but what is the l1 point amazing animation of the moon passing in front of earth from million km away astronomers catch two asteroids making out radarlove it helps to picture him twirling the tip of big handlebar mustache while he talks via love this guy when he talks climate change under ice by kate bush is seriously creepy song my twitter feed has become cryptic here more info on the findings of prebiotic material on the comet by philae new satellite has taken an incredibly beautiful photo of the earth holywow great news we  going to rebootthesuit thanks to every who helped next up preserving alan shepard spacesuit mike huckabee is exactly wrong about global warming and volcanoes and everything pantsonfire relaxin with dr goat is correct here and suspect he would know top to bottom sam batman clayton forrestor jack burton goats is threat to the health of louisanans when we look at astropix are we really seeing what we  seeing note contains me by wow wavy clouds and crescent moon dear dr from harvard how often will your show come out and on what days lease ok folks think have to be done now that was fun but have to write things so can feed my family thanks everyone plot device many of us have been friends for years so yes exoplanets so exciting enterprise then tardis we have direct images of exoplanets now over the next century but it would be regional catastrophe if it did with some global issues sure engineering and physics are relatively easy fed science vessel or tardis but not captain type chariklo an asteroid past saturn with rings embezzle the 450m and buy an island disappearing forever hubble needs servicing so has limited lifetime without humans fixing it hoping to have ideas spacex falcon heavy not as much as my wife and ice cream almost certainly not we see anything that big coming for long long time mostly kinetic energy of collisions but later radioactivity and friction from sinking metals to the core sagan later mostly it was just the science itself plus scifi shows in general niven known space stories given the time they were written hoping to get to the star trek 50th con there next year yes double its budget they  all boys so no talk to planetary sci people way out of that loop by decades not at all they  designed to reflect light back from any direction probably jwst also tech developed to help take direct pix of exoplanets those  be big deal europa enceladus titan one of those guessing hoping there limit probably 200 000 years after bb when because transparent but older than bb nope maybe by tides due to earth oblateness it would take forever though all of it like gravity earth is the only one with chocolate so  hang here get it tested university geology lab maybe think ligo and lisa will do it ligo is super close we  too scared of it which is silly tech is old could be updated relatively easily no my friend seth shostak say 25 years he may be right no avoid all highly addictive drugs garrett nature of dark energy but that easy guess we know much about it we are not prefer moon 1st with an eye toward mars learn then go hard to say but the odds are better now than ever before find kuiper belt object with moon both have fresh surfaces fond of him let see his jack burton but do you love the rock always take the high ground for tactical and surveillance advantage goat tzu ok folks sorry can keep up was just playing around and didn expect hundred question silly of me need break more l8r so far granby and gunnison nice dark spots and then this duh tycho inflation solves lot of problems maybe something better will come along until then ci works well good sounding to see how thick ice shell is especially at cracks where it may be thin goats are fantastic why not goats all of it ha shrinking the peeps and riding the bike square wheels did and like it  heard from astronauts that there are booboos in it need to find out more sure just drop lots of comets on it don just do what can to maximize my impact and minimize theirs if could take transporter there and not spaceship yes lethal in minutes at io alms certainly it already has in its way approached me through 2200 word scripts 46 eps total having fun with them happy like moon first and asteroid second possibly even launched from moon could do both at the same time it contains lot of things find interesting in general planetary nebulae abell 39 is fave rather not say and no like it here on earth try here not by itself it round ended cylinder of various meats chocolate chip haven read it yet but will not yet haven seen it too much to just now plan on it tho bill an old pal hmmm enceladus then move to uranus neptune orbiter we need to sit and watch those planets not just fly by took too long ran hugely over budget but if it works no one will care same thing happened to hubble geologist love rocks that why fond of meteorites best of both worlds so to speak if had to the moon short trip less likely to fry from solar radiation also monolith hunts say earth it not just methane but esters in the gas and we  good at making those biologically unclear depends on how much it affects neptune orbit but that about it could affect comets in kuiper belt hmm interesting nitrogen should work nonflammable easy to compress as long as you have lot cities are heavy nope being in space would be continuous adventure in puking oddly not so enticing for me yup you just need timing info plenty of that online looks for planetarium software predict iss pass observer bed at redacted observatory that was covered in mouse poop creationism and global warming denial not even close gas gets compressed and trans into metallic liquid deep down crush any comers go with uranus to stop all the teeheeing when mention it to high school students have taken too much medication for my back now would be great time to ama use the hashtag asktheba  answer just few this star trek axanar fan film looks amazing and can wait to see it also watch this science video by made me laugh it walks fine line btwn info  really funny women talk show satire what does comet look like from meters

rebootthesuit tbt are the stars you see in the sky already dead hint no four days in and we  85 of the way to preserving neil armstrong apollo 11 spacesuit rebootthesuit again about exoplanet kepler 452b wrote about why we know very little about it other than size very little of the reporting seeing on kepler 452b emphasizes how little we know about it it may be more like neptune than us psa when someone tweets crackpottery at me please include me in your reply  probably already blocked the op if had to bet say 186f is more earth like than 452b is but both are very interesting still lots of planets here to explore too hmmm it takes about 11 million years to drive light year packalunch for ppl complaining that 1400 light years is too far away 20 light years isn exactly walking distance this is an important discovery but note it still incremental we  closer to finding an earth twin but not quite there yet astronomers find an earth ish planet around sun ish star just lost the press conference feed drat have care here this is good and important but not sure it as groundbreaking as 186f was ok so this new planet kepler 452b orbits star more like our sun 186f orbits red dwarf that great and happy but listening to nasa exoplanet press conference curious what new here since we know about kepler 186f spacewalking at comic con with and your daily goat goat mate the soyuz capsule has been captured and is now part of the international space station soyuz is now meters from iss alllllllmost there wow so pretty soyuz on final approach to iss soyuz on approach 190 meters from iss oh wow you can see that only one solar panel deployed on the soyuz not threat but sure that  be something roscosmos looking at soyuz module is docking with iss right now watch live btw folks if you like launches both crewed  robotic then follow who is amazingly well versed is rockety stuff 3rd stage engine cutoff and they are in orbit love it when launch goes well love it when soyuz astronauts use the finglonger funny you can tell by the swinging of the r2d2 that they are under gt 1g acceleration oscillation period is too short liftoff more humans on their way to space watching the live

explains it pretty well oh this shot of the moon and venus came out nicely as it gets darker look for the star regulus above venus and jupiter to the right the moon is just over 400 000 km away venus is 58 million 145 times farther away venus and the moon taken just few minutes ago you can see the crescent on venus venus and moon show very similar phase we  seeing them in roughly the same geometry with the sun and that defines phase shape the sun is still up bit and clearly saw venus and moon thru binocs venus is clearly crescent autocorrect you know phaser do you not know me at all cc did all see the latest weird pix from pluto charon yesterday hummocky ice fields  sinking mountain wat just fixed our vacuum cleaner so am now basically well saw venus easily in my binocs but nothing with just my eyes it bit too cloudy here  try again later might try to look for venus in broad daylight today but it hard observation must be very careful of sun 20 away for this of us in the us there moon

so was just screwing around kinda glad they used it have been to the iridium layer clay deposit shown in the episode too made video about it nice to see old friend like  in the show as well also dan durda an undergrad buddy of mine just watched how the universe works how the universe built your car it really good best ep of the series yet if you want goats you need goat fence farmerphil ula launched gps sat yesterday to upgrade the us network via tbt from pluto the sun would be starlike point but an intensely bright one  wanna see where the stars live ok but this ain hollywood agreed happy birthday you age you just look more like me every year handsomer new horizons covers million km per day and it still took years to get to pluto and here we are gaping at pictures it took but what drove those pluto mountains upward this is critical question not what there but how it got there on pluto water ice is so cold it harder than rock makes for good mountain building smaller than rockies but pluto lt earth pluto charon wow wow humanity first look at the frontier of the solar system pluto has mountains of water ice coated with thin surface of methane and nitrogen ice alien world indeed what could be driving surfacing  mtn formation no tides from nearby planet and it tidally locked with charon no impact craters at all in this image that means it young resurfaced maybe lt 100 million years old very young holy jumping god of the underworld one frame of pluto mosaic from the bottom left of the heart holy wow the heart on pluto is now informally named tombaugh regio nicely done clyde tombaugh discovered pluto new horizons pictures still not online yet at website charon evidence of activity faulting resurfacing only few craters so surface young hydra one of pluto small moons is lumpy highly pixellated but it shaped like potato 28 19 miles in size nasa press conference revealing close up pluto pix starts in few minutes see how much better the best just got from hubble to new horizons in 1979 artist dixon predicted what pluto would look like and he nailed it it occurs to me pluto was above the horizon for most of the us when that signal washed over the earth it passed through many of us data from pluto  charon and moons will start coming down early in the morning press conference is scheduled for 00 edt wed other goat goat more goat goat never thought this would happen but guess goat person now nasa news briefing is scheduled for 30 edt 20 minutes from now very happy update for my pluto post woohoo hot damn new horizons survived and is doing just fine everything nominal nasa speak for healthy and working well new horizons is alive the ok signal still has 900 million km to go to get here but it  only take 50 minutes lightisfast we are now about one hour from hearing from new horizons telling us it ok the first signal since the flyby if you watch the how the universe works premier tonight you may see some familiar faces hinthint actually seeing bit of this on twitter remember pluto doesn care what you cal it did you hear we  headed for an ice age yeah that claim is what comes out the south end of north facing bull questions about the flyby timing when we  see what has you covered assuming  done my math right of course and accounted for time delay in the signal if new horizons survived its encounter with pluto then it just sent signal back to earth to let us know well see it in hours it took new horizons yrs to get to pluto our own journey took much longer subscription only seconded canis major celebrates encounter day by being vaguely pluto colored what if new horizons hit your car here is the 2nd coolest pluto pic today seen through comet snowstorm saw this blue heron nab fish right before taking this pic held phone

someone took pic at sdcc with  with me photobombing and now can find it btw new horizons is now less than 12 hours from closest pluto approach but we won see images until much later in lt hours new horizons will be closer to pluto than the moon is to earth closest approach is hours later 14 km is fast why are we flying past pluto and not orbiting it watch this my friend via my friend want some
